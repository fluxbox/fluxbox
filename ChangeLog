      with other implementations of STL (Thanks Raphael Kubo da Costa)
    * Bugfix: Fix detection of $HOME folder

13/06/18:
    * Speedup: Use binary search to find longest possible text
      to render. A malignant webpage could set a document title with something
      like this: document.title = new Array(4999).join(".") and then fluxbox
      would waste lots of cycles upon detecting the renderable width for that
      title. Closes #1090
    * Bugfix: Fix maximum length for text. XGlyphInfo.xOff is a signed short 
      and thus it handles "only" ~32k pixels. A monospace font with a font-size
      of 10 pixels will overflow after ~ 3276 glyphs.

               client patterns via 'fluxbox-remote'
    * Bugfix: Handle FbTk::Timers with equal end time correctly

    * Build-system improvements (Thanks Sami Kerola)
    * Combile fix: forgotten parentheses in code for MacOS


-----------------------------
Changes for 1.3.3

    * Added 'OnTab' modifier for Keys file (Thanks Julien Viard de Galbert)

*12/10/02:
    * Improved vertical alignment of text in FbTk::TextButton (Mathias)
      New formula: (height - font_ascent) / 2 - 1. Better results when the
      Iconbar is configured to use different fonts (eg, ClockTool and
      IconButtons)

*12/09/14:
    * Fixed regression: Use microseconds in DelayCmd (Mathias)
    * Bugfix: (re)setting timeouts on a running FbTk::Timber corrupts timer
      list (Mathias)

*12/09/09:
    * Added actions 'NearestCorner', 'NearestEdge', 'NearestCornerOrEdge'
      (Thanks Michael Abbott)

*12/08/28:
    * Changed timer functions to use a monotonic increasing clock (Mathias)
      gettimeofday() is subject to be changed on daylight-saving or other
      ntp-related events (leap-seconds). It might also change back in time.
      clock_gettime() (or mach_absolute_time() on MacOSX) are monotonic
      increasing and do not change back in time. See FbTk::FbTime.

*12/07/29:
    * Fix placement of transient Windows (Thanks Peter Hercek)
      There might be 'holes' in a given multimonitor setup. Windows should not
      be (mis)placed in such invisible areas.

*12/07/27:

*11/10/15:
    * Cleaned master translation file from obsolete stuff (Thanks skizzhg)
      Marked obsolete entries as _OBSOLTE to help other translators to identify
      them. Also, removed entries which are meant for error reporting anyway.
    * Updated italian translation (Thanks skizzhg)

*11/09/17:
    * Tons of changes all over the place (Pavel)
      RefCount, FbTk::Timer, const Signals, Documentation fixes etc

*11/09/11:
    * Compilefix: build without 'iconv' support (Thanks to Peter Korsgaard)

*11/09/10:
    * Bugfix: sync the copied config files to the disk before continuing to
      launch. This avoids possible race conditions, eg. under MacOSX (Mathias)

*11/09/01:
    * Relicense 'ostrich' theme (to please Debian / Ubuntu) (Sven)
    * Bugfix: Do not change workspaces when using NextWindow/PrevWindow in toolbar (Mathias)

*11/08/26:
    * Mapping keysyms to keycodes after 'MappingNotify', closes #3386257 (Mathias)
    * Regrab ButtonMotionMask, needed for 'Move' events in .fluxbox/keys (Mathias)

      parentrelative labels (Thanks Nacitar Sevaht)

*11/05/10:
    * Use the new signal system exclusively (Pavel)
      In 2010 Henrik introduced a new signal/slot system as a replacement
      to the observer/subject code. That transition was never completed.
      Pavel cleaned up the missing parts, fixed some crashes related to
      restart() / shutdown of fluxbox.

*11/05/09:
    * Fix build system (Pavel)

    * Bugfix: AlphaMenu did not show correct alpha values (#3187373) (Mathias)
      g++ -Os triggered strange conflict with returning 'int' values from an

*11/02/21:
    * Better option for 'feh' when keeping aspect ration (thanks Jeremiah Mahler)

*11/02/03:
    * Allow to override 'Focus New Windows' via .fluxbox/apps (thanks Peter Hercek)
    * Bugfix: semantical difference between WinState::Decoration and
      Remember::save() (thanks Peter)

*11/02/25:
    * Added 'fontconfig' as link dependency if Xft is used (Mathias)

*11/01/24:
    * Added syntax / coloring for 'Vim' to '3rd/vim'

*11/01/18:
    * Bugfix: Prevent SIGFPE when using nxserver, closes #2813828 (Mathias)

*11/01/15:
    * Code cleanup (Mathias)

*11/01/06:
    * Bugfix: handle result of DisplayString() correctly, bug #3136775 (Mathias)
      fluxbox assumed that the result of DisplayString() contains always the
      screen number. This is not the case in some (newer) versions of libX11.

*10/10/13:
    * Bugfix: handle situation when DISPLAY is not set (Mathias)

*10/09/21:
    * Bugfix: use system() for launching 'fluxbox-update_configs' (Mathias)
      FbCommands::ExecuteCmd() was used before. This changes the config
      while fluxbox is loading (from the config), this caused some nasty
      effects on 'slower' systems. system() now blocks until
      'fluxbox-update_configs' is done and then launches flubox.

*10/09/19:
    * Compile fix: fluxbox loves g++-4.1 again (Mathias)

*10/09/18:
    * Bugfix: redesigned bootstrapping (Mathias)
      The old bootstrap could lead to corrupt files. We now first
      bootstrap, then try to upgrade potentially old config files and
      after that we bring up flubox. This eliminates to signal USR2
      from 'fluxbox-update_configs' the current running fluxbox
      instance and retriggering bootstrapping and updating the config
      files which could again lead to resignal fluxbox.

*10/09/17:
    * New command 'ArrangeWindowsVertical' (thanks John K Pate)
    * Code clean up (Mathias)
    * Bugfix: do use soon-to-be-dead pointers for putenv() (Mathias)

*10/09/15:
    * Bugfix: correct refcounting of the corner shapes (Mathias)
    * Code clean up (Mathias)

*10/09/14:
    * Bugfix: create corner pixmaps of FbTk::Shape only once per Screen (Mathias)
    * Bugfix: correctly free corner pixmaps of FbTk::Shape (Mathias)
    * Continue to clean up code (Mathias)

*10/09/13:
    * Continue to clean up code (Mathias)

*10/09/11:
    * Implemented simple tagging mechanism (Mathias)
      Apply (or delete) a 'tag' with the new command "SetXProp TAG1=yes",
      then use the client pattern mechanism to match such 'tagged'
      windows, eg. "NextWindow (@TAG1=yes)"
    * Add '(workspace=[current])' to default keys-file (Mathias)
      Upgraded the config version to '13', also updated 'fluxbox-update_configs'
      to add '(workspace=[current])' to old '~/.fluxbox/keys' for lines
      having 'NextWindow/PrevWindow/NextGroup/PrevGroup'.
    * Code cleanup for 'fluxbox-update_configs' (Mathias)
      Moved the code for each 'update step' into its own function.

*10/09/10:
    * Do not limit cycleFocus() to windows on the current workspace (Mathias)
      This could be achieved by adding '(workspace=[current])' to the client
      pattern of the command anyway.
      Closes #1732115: 'focus urgent (chat) windows on other workspaces'
    * Continue to clean up code (Mathias)

*10/09/09:
    * Bugfix: 'Shape' of a menu was created before the parent window (Mathias)
    * Continue to clean up the code base, mostly by using FbTk::Util::clamp()

*10/09/08:
    * Introduced 'FbTk::BidiString' which holds both the logical content and
      the visual reordered version of the content of a string. this helps to
      reduce the number of calls to reorder the string before drawing it (as
      introduced in the patch from Ken Bloom) and to be more consistent
      in menus and textboxes (drawing cursors and underlining text). (Mathias)
    * Minor changes all over the place, mostly by using simpler or shared
      code (Mathias)

*10/09/05:
    * Added support for bidirectional text (thanx to Ken Bloom), bug #2801836

*10/08/24:
    * Code deduplication and simplification (Mathias)

*10/08/20:
    * Added new action 'ActivateTab' (Mathias)

*10/06/01:
   * Added new focus model 'StrictMouseFocus'.  This will affect focus when
     closing, moving, lowering windows, changing desktops, etc, whereas the
     'MouseFocus' model will only change focus when you move the mouse (Jim)

*10/05/01:
   * Fixed placement bug of maximized windows when moved out of a xinerama
     screen (Mathias)

*10/04/30:
   * Bugfix: _NET_WM_STATE was not set correctly on 64bit systems (Mathias)

*10/03/26:
   * Changed title signal from Focusable to use the new signal system (Henrik)

   * Make fbsetbg quieter on '-z' if there's no lastwallpaper (Jim)
   * Add new "background: unset" property for use in overlays. (Jim)
   * Key file parsing error for MacroCmd with unterminated {...} pairs (Jim)
   * Many documentation updates (Jim):
     * Rewrote most manpages into asciidoc format
     * Split monolithic fluxbox(1) into fluxbox-apps(5), fluxbox-menu(5)
     * Renamed fluxstyle(1) to fluxbox-style(5)

*08/11/01:
   * Don't reload keys file when modifier map changes, just regrab (Mark)

*08/10/15:
   * Don't allow resizing to negative dimensions (Mathias)
   * Ignore XRandr events that don't change the screen size (Mark)

*08/10/13:

*08/08/18:
   * Combined code for MoveTo key command and saved window positions (Mark)
     Side effects:
     - both now have the following options: TopLeft Left BottomLeft Top Center
       Bottom TopRight Right BottomRight
     - the CENTER reference in apps now behaves like WINCENTER
     - some previously saved positions will be wrong, since they are now
       computed relative to the toolbar and slit
     - CENTER/WINCENTER will now work properly with Xinerama when placing the
       window on a head other than the top left one
   * Add Top Center, Left Center, Right Center, and Bottom Center tab placement
     options (Mark)

   * Only reload the keys file if the contents have changed (Mark)
   * Modifying the apps file no longer requires a reconfigure (Mark)

     after a delay of <int> microseconds (default is 200 milliseconds) (Mark)

*07/12/25:
   * Updated german translations for maximization menu (thanks Christian Loosli)
   * Removed KDE configure option, since it didn't do anything (Mark)
   * Added resource session.screen<N>.slit.acceptKdeDockapps: <boolean> (Mark)

*07/12/23:
   * Added new style items window.(un)focus.border{Width,Color} (Mark)

*07/12/21:
   * Added new key command :StartTabbing (Mark)

*07/12/20:
   * Added new key command :ForEach (or :Map) (Mark)
     - :ForEach {<command>} [{ [{<list opts>}] [<bool command>] }]
     - For example, the following command will shade all windows on the current
       workspace: ForEach {shade} {{groups} Matches (workspace=[current])}
     - <list opts> can be any combination of `static' and `groups' where static
       means windows are listed in creation order, and groups means individual
       tabs are not considered separately
     - This replaces syntax such as `:Minimize (layer)', which no longer works

*07/12/19:
   * Don't let transient windows steal focus from other programs (Mark)

*07/12/18:
   * NLS entries for Mouse Tab Focus and Click Tab Focus were switched - please
     make sure they're right now in your language, bug #1786566 (Mark)
   * Open transient windows on same workspace as parent (thanks Sascha Hunold)
   * Holding control while clicking on a menu item will now keep the menu open (Mark)

     (thanks Martin)

*07/12/14:
   * Fix compiling with gcc 4.3 (thanks Dmitry E. Oboukhov)

*07/12/13:
   * Fix configure option --with-style (thanks Slava Semushin)
   * Close menus only when they lose focus (Mark)
   * Moved command parsing code all over the place -- expect any patches that
     add new commands to be broken (Mark, Simon)

*07/12/11:
   * Added new resize modes for key command StartResizing: NearestEdge, Left,
     Right, Top, Bottom (Mark)
   * Only allow one menu to be open at a time (Mark)

*07/12/09:
   * Added OnTitlebar and Double modifiers to the keys file for clicks on the
     titlebar and double clicks, respectively (Mark, thanks Matteo Galiazzo)
     - For example, `OnTitlebar Double Mouse3 :Maximize' will maximize a window
       when you double click on the titlebar with the right mouse button
     - Note: if you have commands bound to both a single and double click, the
       single click command will still be executed on the first half of a double
       click
     - Added new key commands ShadeOn and ShadeOff that set whether or not a
       window is shaded, rather than toggling the current state

*07/11/22:
   * Added some new special keys to the keys file: FocusIn, FocusOut, MouseOver,
     MouseOut, ChangeWorkspace (Mark)
     - FocusIn/FocusOut correspond to a window gaining or losing focus, e.g. the
       following will raise all xterms when one gains focus:
       FocusIn :If {Matches (xterm)} {Raise (xterm)} {}
     - MouseOver/MouseOut correspond to the mouse moving over the window or
       toolbar (when used with OnToolbar) -- OnDesktop not yet supported, e.g.
       the following will unshade a window when you move your mouse over it with
       alt pressed:
       Mod1 MouseOver :If {Matches (shaded=yes)} {Shade} {}
     - ChangeWorkspace corresponds to the workspace being changed, e.g. the
       following will set a different wallpaper for each workspace:
       ChangeWorkspace :Exec fbsetbg ~/.fluxbox/bg$(xprop -root _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP | awk '{print $3}').png
   * Added translations for zh_TW (thanks Wei-Lun Chao)
   * Fix division by 0 error when resize increments are set to 0 by an
     application, bug #1836182
   * Added conditional statements to key commands (Mark)
     - for example, this will search for an open xterm window, cycle through
       them if there are any, or else open one:
       Mod4 t :If {Some Matches (xterm)} {NextWindow (xterm)} {Exec xterm}
     - the syntax is :If {<test>} {<command if true>} {<command if false>}
     - `Matches <pattern>' is currently the only test you can make; when used
       alone, it tests the focused window or the clicked window for OnWindow
       mouse events
     - there are many ways to combine tests:
       - `Some <test>' returns true if any open client matches <test>
       - `Every <test>' returns true if every open client matches <test>
       - `Not <test>' negates the value of <test>
       - `Or {<test>} {<test>} ...' returns true if any of the tests is true
       - `And {<test>} {<test>} ...' returns true if all of the tests are true
       - `Xor {<test>} {<test>} ...' returns the boolean xor of the truth values

*07/11/16:
   * Added new key command :Focus [<pattern>] that focuses a window (e.g., using
     OnWindow or specified using a window pattern) (Mark, thanks Tomas Janousek)
   * Using ToggleDecor from Deco=TAB should hide tabs (thanks Tomas Janousek)

*07/11/12:
   * Allow arbitrary window patterns for the iconbar mode (Mark)
     - Note: for now, if you match against the current head of a window, it will
       not be updated as expected in the toolbar

*07/11/08:
   * Fix crash when cycling focus and window closes, bug #1787345 (Mark)

*07/11/04:
   * Update autoraise delay on reconfigure (Mark)

*07/10/31:
   * Move fullscreen windows to normal layer when they lose focus (Mark)

*07/10/24:
   * Fixed some gcc 2.96 compile issues ( Henrik )
   * Introduced (workspacename=...) for pattern matching and changed
     (workspace=...) to use the workspace number, indexed from 0 (Mark)
   * Reenabled raising window if window was moved by mouse by 0 pixels (Mathias)

*07/10/23:
   * Adding/removing workspaces wasn't updating menu (Mark)
   * Support remembering maximized, minimized, and fullscreen state (Mark)
     - [Maximized] {yes|no|horz|vert}
     - [Minimized] {yes|no}
     - [Fullscreen] {yes|no}
     - also fixed window placement when remembering head but not position
   * Allow negated patterns, e.g. (name!=xterm) (Mark)

*07/10/22:
   * Added option "mouse" to client pattern ( Henrik )
     This is usefull for xinerama. For example:
     Mod1 Tab :NextWindow (head=[mouse]) 
     This will cycle focus through windows that are on the same head as 
     the mouse pointer.
   * Fixed crash bug at restart. ( Henrik )
   * Replaced modKey with new commands StartMoving and StartResizing (Mark)
     - your keys file should be updated automatically
     - they must be used with a mouse button, or they won't work
     - StartResizing takes one or none of the following arguments:
       NearestCorner, Center, TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft, BottomRight

*07/10/21:
   * Allow decorations bitmask to be specified using '0x' (Mark)

*07/10/18:
   * Fixed gcc 2.96 compile problem ( Thanks rumpole at hotmail )
     bug #1809786

*07/10/15:
   * Added OnWindow modifier to keys file (Mark)

*07/10/14:
   * Added support for transient windows in window patterns, e.g.
     (transient=yes|no), defaulting to "no" for the apps file (Mark)
   * Bugfix for SendToPrevWorkspace/TakeToPrevWorkspace (Mathias)

*07/10/13:
   * Merged pre-devel branch; see all Changes since 1.0.0 (Mark)
   * Updated ru_RU (Thanks Konstantin Shashkin)
   * deiconify windows via :Deiconify in reverse order (Mathias)

*07/05/23:
   * Added key command :Attach <pattern> which groups all windows matching the
     given pattern (Mark)

*07/05/20:
   * Added resources session.screen<N>.maxDisable{Move,Resize}: <boolean>, which
     prevent maximized windows from being moved/resized (Mark)

*07/05/19:
   * Changed behavior of resource session.screen<N>.followModel (Mark)
     - now only options are Ignore and Follow, the latter using the setting in
       session.screen<N>.userFollowModel

*07/05/16:
   * Added new resource session.screen<N>.noFocusWhileTypingDelay: <int> (Mark)
     - specifies a time in milliseconds that new windows should not gain focus
       while the user is typing in the focused window

*07/05/13:
   * Added new placement policies {Row,Col}MinOverlapPlacement. They behave the
     same as {Row,Col}SmartPlacement when the window fits but fall back on
     minimizing overlap with other windows instead of CascadePlacement (Mark)

*07/04/23:
   * Set IconicState on all unmapped clients and unmap clients with frames, as
     per ICCCM 4.1.4 (Mark)
   * Added ClientMenu key command, which pops up a menu of open windows, based
     on a pattern match
     - e.g. :ClientMenu (workspace=[current]) (minimized=no)

*07/04/11:
   * Added resource session.screen<N>.maxIgnoreIncrement: <boolean>, to
     disable size checking when maximizing a window (e.g. terminals) (Mark)
     - Also added a new configuration submenu for maximize options, to be filled
       at a later date

*07/04/08:
   * Added OnToolbar modifier to keys file (Mark)

*07/04/06:
   * More changes to theme handling (Mark)
     - introduced window.label.(un)focused.{justify,border{Color,Width}},
       which fallback to window.label.{justify,border{Color,Width}} before
       window.{justify,border{Color,Width}}
     - this has the backwards-incompatible effect that
       toolbar.iconbar.(un)focused.* fallback first to toolbar.iconbar.* and
       then to window.label.*

*07/04/03:
   * Added window.label.(un)focused.font to styles (Mark)

*07/03/31:
   * [group] tag in apps file may now have a pattern appended to it, and a new
     window will only be automatically attached to the group if the group
     matches that pattern -- e.g. [group] (workspace) (shaded=no) will only
     automatically group with windows on the current workspace that are not
     shaded (Mark)
   * Lots of window commands now take a client pattern as an additional
     argument, and the command will then be applied to all matching windows
     (Mark)
     - For example: `SendToWorkspace 2 (xterm)' will send all xterm windows to
       workspace 2
     - Here is the full list of affected commands (which is not to imply they
       all necessarily make sense to do): Fullscreen, Minimize, Maximize,
       MaximizeVertical, MaximizeHorizontal, SetAlpha, Resize, ResizeTo,
       ResizeHorizontal, ResizeVertical, MoveTo, Move, MoveRight, MoveLeft,
       MoveUp, MoveDown, Raise, RaiseLayer, Lower, LowerLayer, Close, Kill,
       Shade, Stick, ToggleDecor, SetHead, Tab, SendToNextWorkspace,
       SendToPrevWorkspace, TakeToNextWorkspace, TakeToPrevWorkspace,
       SendToWorkspace, TakeToWorkspace, NextTab, PrevTab, MoveTabLeft,
       MoveTabRight, DetachClient

*07/03/30:
   * Changed syntax for window cycling (Mark)
     - Instead of a bitmask, the window cycling functions NextWindow,
       PrevWindow, TypeAheadFocus, and GoToWindow now take a list of options
       enclosed in {} followed by a pattern similar to those used in the apps
       file.
     - Examples:
         * NextWindow {static groups} (shaded=yes) (name=xterm)
           - cycles through all shaded xterms in creation order, only focusing
             the active tab in the group
         * GoToWindow 3 (title=[current])
           - focuses the third client in last-focused order with the same title
             as the currently focused window
     - The options are: name, class, title, role, maximized, minimized, shaded,
       stuck, focushidden (can't be disabled), iconhidden, workspace (matches
       workspace names, not numbers), head (numbers), and layer (names)
     - Parsing is a pain, so you'll have to update your keys file yourself for
       now.

*07/03/29:
   * Removed groups file; entries will be added to the apps file automatically (Mark)
   * Fixed a problem with programs starting in IconicState (Mark)

*07/03/27:
   * Added new resource session.screen<N>.clientMenu.usePixmap that puts the
     window's icon in the workspace and icons menus: default true. (Mark)
     - For some reason, it doesn't work with un-shaped icons yet, but I've spent
       way too many hours already trying to figure out why
   * Use IconTitle in iconbar for minimized windows (Mark)

*07/03/25:
   * Added new resource session.screen<N>.tabs.usePixmap that puts the window's
     icon in the tab, if available. This is on by default. (Mark)

*07/03/24:
   * Added new key command GoToWindow (Mark)
     - Syntax is GoToWindow <int> [<bitmask>], where the int gives the position
       of the desired window with respect to a list of windows, and the bitmask
       is the same as for NextWindow. A negative number for <int> will count
       back from the end of the list.
     - Particularly useful examples are GoToWindow <int> 9 and
       GoToWindow <int> 25, which will focus the window at position <int> in the
       iconbar modes Workspace and WorkspaceNoIcons, respectively.
   * Fixed creation order window cycling with tabbed windows (Mark)
*07/03/21:
   * Added new command TypeAheadFocus (Mark)
     - syntax is the same as for NextWindow; when you run the command, you can
       start typing the title of the window, and it will gain focus; pressing
       tab will cycle through all matching entries using the options specified;
       when you've found the window you want, just press return or escape

--------------------------------

*07/08/09:
   * Fix shaping handling, stage 2, (Simon)
     - rewrite the core of the Shape handling so that it properly 
       merges client and frame shapes. Fixes all sorts of odd shaping
       behaviour, and incidentally xeyes now gets a visible frame 
       (not having the frame was actually a bug).
   * Fix shaping handling, stage 1, (Simon)
     - do borders properly with rounded corners
     - propagate client clip mask as well as bounding mask

       (nogui) sets the vo driver name as the instance name.
   * Fix menu heading encoding (Simon) 
     sf.net bug #1712583: NLS:Non-latin characters displayed incorrectly in menu title

     (including gaim/pidgin crash-on-restart)
     sf.net #1524098, #1633718 (and older?)

*07/07/31:
   * Change _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_MENU to use TOOL decoration type (Mark)

*07/07/24:
   * Don't allow ToggleDecor with fullscreen windows, and make it show
     decorations for windows that don't have a titlebar by default (Mark)

*07/07/08:
   * Clean up state and workspace window properties on client close (Mark)

*07/07/07:
   * Don't overwrite changes to init file on reconfigure (Mark)
   * Make things work a little better with configure script's --program-prefix
     and --program-suffix options (Mark)
   * Allow negative numbers in :Workspace <int> command, which counts backwards
     from the last one (Mark)
   * Right clicking on a submenu didn't revert focus to its parent (Mark)
   * Pressing escape in a torn menu didn't work (Mark)
   * Save workspace names when changing through menu, bug #1748967 (Mark)

*07/07/06:
   * When saving window information, use the class name instead of instance name
     by default (Mark)
   * Prevent apps (e.g. MPlayer) from moving/resizing just after creation if the
     position/size is saved in the apps file (Mark)

*07/07/03:
   * Avoid some problems with tabbed windows and resize increments (Mark)
   * Added utility fluxbox-remote, which allows script access to most fluxbox
     commands; support must be turned on in the init file with
     session.screen<N>.allowRemoteActions; the syntax is, e.g.,
     fluxbox-remote "CustomMenu ~/.fluxbox/custommenu" (Mark)
   * Update systemtray and KDE dockapps in slit when background changes (Mark)
   * Fixed resource usage due to Skype 1.4, bug #1745678 (Mark)

*07/07/02:
   * Remember original size/position in apps file for shaded or maximized
     windows (Mark)
   * Enabled Xinerama and Imlib2 support by default (Mark)
   * Fixed handle rendering when switching from a style without them (Mark)
   * Changed :Tab <int> key command so that the last tab is focused if <int> is
     larger than the number of tabs (or first if <int> is negative and |<int>|

--------------------------------
Changes for 1.0rc3:

     large (thanks Tomas Janousek)

     - :CustomMenu /path/to/file

   * Fixed display bug with ParentRelative menu highlight (thanks Julien Trolet)

*07/03/10:
   * Autogrouped windows weren't getting added to the workspace menu (Mark)
   * Changed default toolbar layer to DOCK, as a large window could render
     fluxbox useless to a new user otherwise (Mark)

*07/03/07:

     at nomi dot cz>

   * Update systemtray alpha along with toolbar alpha (Mark)

*07/02/23:
   * Update EWMH state atom when maximizing windows (Mark)
   * Update titlebar buttons on reconfigure (Mark)

   * Make systemtray support XEMBED protocol (Mark)

*07/02/21:
   * Buttons should only run a command if the mouse was clicked down on the
     same button, e.g. bug #1437864 (Mark)

*07/02/17:
   * Slit was creating a strut even when it wasn't visible (Mark)
   * Update workspace names on reconfigure, and don't overwrite workspace names
     not being used (Mark)
   * Fixed some issues with transients of inactive tabs (Mark)

     (Mark + thanks Jim Ramsay)
   * Fixed a bug with `session.ignoreBorder: true' (Mark)
   * Fixed a bug with resizing windows for clients when only the width is
     specified (Mark)

*07/02/09:
   * Introduced support for mouse buttons in the keys file (Mark)
     - Mouse buttons are bound to new `keys' Mouse1, Mouse2, etc.
     - Also a new modifier `OnDesktop' to specify actions that should take place
       when you click on the desktop -- without this, mouse bindings are global
     - Obviously, more modifiers are planned, so don't ask
     - Introduced new command HideMenus
     - Added a utility to the project that automatically updates configuration
       files when we change the syntax -- your current mouse bindings on the
       desktop will be added to your keys file automatically

*07/02/06:
   * Wrong window was being raised when attaching an unfocused window (Mark)
   * Make selecting `close' from the workspace menu close the correct client,
     rather than the active tab in the window -- selecting `close' from right
     clicking on a tab is still wrong, as there are complications (Mark)

*07/02/05:
   * Made some changes to the way autogrouping in the apps file works (Mark)
     - Introduced new syntax [group] (workspace) to group new windows only with
       windows on the current workspace
     - Fixed an unreported bug with grouping windows on multiple screens
     - Groups are now associated with clients rather than windows, so they
       will be more robust when attaching or detaching tabs and when restarting
       fluxbox

*07/02/04:
   * Layer wasn't set properly on remembered windows, and the layer menu
     wasn't getting updated properly, bugs #1535304, #1572683, #1646740 (Mark)
   * Clicking on the edge of a button didn't work, bugs #1060891, #1517747 (Mark)

*07/02/02:
   * Reverted patch from svn 4684, allowing transparency in window buttons,
     until we get it working with titlebar transparency, since the old buggy
     behavior at least didn't break settings already in use (Mark)
   * Update window transparency immediately when using pseudotransparency,
     also introduced new key command: SetAlpha [[+-]<int> [[+-]<int>]] (Mark)
     - with no arguments, returns the focused window to default settings
     - with one argument, changes both focused and unfocused settings the same
       way
     - with two arguments, the first changes the focused alpha, and the second
       changes the unfocused alpha
     E.g. SetAlpha 127 +5 will set the focused alpha to 127 and increment the
     unfocused alpha by 5 (until it reaches 255)

*07/01/26:
   * Fix default workspace names, and don't show empty menus (Mark)
   * Opening a window on a different workspace with Focus New Windows enabled
     should focus the window when you get to that workspace -- as a free bonus,
     stacking order should be more stable on fluxbox restart (Mark)

*07/01/25:
   * Don't raise any windows above OverrideRedirect windows, otherwise they
     eventually get pushed to the bottomm, bug #1447583 (Mark)

*07/01/24:
   * Detect user's shell from environment rather than assuming /bin/sh (Mark)

*07/01/21:
   * Little fix for closing tabs with non-default gravity (Mark)
     Window.cc
   * Several fixes for menu behavior (Mark)
     - always give focus to the menu with the highlighted item
     - revert focus to menu when no other windows will take it
     - don't reopen closed submenus when moving the menu

*07/01/20:
   * Make sure styles don't change the lastwallpaper in fbsetbg (Mark)
   * Let styles override rootCommand in init file -- for the old behavior, add
     `background: none' to the overlay file (Mark)
   * Don't place windows over toolbar at the top of the screen (Mark)

*07/01/16:
   * Make right-clicking on iconbar button behave the same way as tabs (Mark)
   * Don't force user to reconfigure manually in order to apply menu and
     default window transparency changes; instead, in order to conserve system
     resources, do it a half-second after the user stops changing them (Mark)

*07/01/15:
   * Prevent per-window alpha menu from scrolling past 0 or 255 (Mark)
   * Fix rootmenu disappearing on reconfigure (Mark)

*07/01/14:
   * Stay on the same workspace after a restart (Mark)
   * Properly 'properly fix' shaded and stuck windows on restart -- i.e. allow
     windows to deiconify themselves the rest of the time (Mark)
   * Several changes for background style option: (Mark)
     - now support `background: mod' to coincide with fbsetroot -mod --
       In addition to `background.color' and `background.colorTo', this option
       must also set `background.modX' and `background.modY' to integers
     - added `background: none' for styles that do not include a background
     - fixed bug with style backgrounds not getting set when changing styles
     - updated default styles to be valid wrt background options
   * Minor fix for window cycling on multiple screens (Mark)

*07/01/13:
   * Only change focus order when user specifically focuses a window (Mark)

*07/01/11:
   * Added option to :Minimize key command to lower all windows in the same
     layer as the focused window -- syntax is `:Minimize (layer)' (Mark)

*07/01/08:
   * Fix another 64-bit window property (Mark/Simon)

*07/01/07:
   * Update Iconbar Mode menu when updating settings (Mark)
   * Fixed workspace warping going crazy, bug #1467124 (Mark)
   * Fix little bug with iconbar rendering, bug #1549209 (Mark)
   * Fix RefCount crash and Slit deconstruction ordering (Simon)
   * Support per-window transparency settings.
      (Simon and thanks Julien Trolet, dmxen at sourceforge dot net)
       sf.net patch #1511042, feature #1108692
      - new "Transparency" menu in the window menu
      - new apps file attribute: 
         [alpha] {int int} (or just {int})
        Where numbers represent focused and unfocused transparency, 
        respectively. One number only will be used for both.
      - Also, show toggle status for shade and stick in window menu.

*07/01/06:
   * Updated nb_NO translations (thanks emptydoor at users dot sf dot net)
   * Changing session.forcePseudotransparency no longer requires restart,
     also a little code cleanup in FbTk/Transparent.cc/hh (Mark)
   * Move triangle drawing into a generic function in FbDrawable (Simon)
     Make submenu triangles in MenuItems proportional to the icon size
     (alternate implementation of sf.net patch #1526813)

*07/01/05:
   * When a client in an unfocused tab creates a transient window, set that
     client to the active tab (Mark)
   * Window wasn't staying focused when dragging across workspaces with
     outline window moving (Mark)
   * Fix placement of window menu with toolbar at the top of the screen,
     and remove titlebar from window menu (Mark)
   * Don't change focus to a window that doesn't accept focus (Mark)
   * Only grab keybindings on screens managed by fluxbox (Mark)
   * Fix locale being applied to the clock. (Simon)
     - Also fixed a likely locale-killer for BSDs (without nl_langinfo)
   * Fix nls digit strings to prefix with zero "%4d" => "%04d" for proper 
     spacing (Simon)
   * Fix loading of rotated fonts on style change (Simon)
   * Change default Xft font to "monospace" (was "fixed") (Simon)
     - The "fixed" font loads a bitmap Xfont
     - Note that bitmap fonts do not rotate properly, and especially the 
       baseline isn't adjusted for the lack of rotation. Thus we recommend
       that if you are using a bitmapped font (e.g. artwiz), then specify it
       using xfld style (-*-snap-*-*-* ...etc) so that fluxbox loads it with 
       traditional XFont/XmbFont calls, resulting in correct placement and 
       rotation.

*07/01/04:
   * Added new resource for init file to control default window decorations:
     session.screenN.defaultDeco: <bitmask>, where the bitmask corresponds
     to the one used for [Deco] in the apps file (Mark)
   * Move minimized windows to the back of the focused list (Mark)

*07/01/03:
   * Don't run [startup] items in apps file on fluxbox restart (Mark)

*07/01/02:
   * Don't escape regular expression metacharacters in apps file, bug
     #1595497 (Mark)

*07/01/01:
   * Happy New Year!
   * Don't draw style's menu icon pixmap underneath the program's icon (Mark)
   * Don't run [startup] items in apps file if fluxbox fails to start (Mark)
   * Don't run [startup] items in apps file on reconfigure (Mark)
   * Fix data type of data passed to set _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS (Simon)
     (sf.net #1621980)
     Similar fix for gnome current workspace... remember that XA_CARDINAL
     "32-bit" type is actually a "long array" argument (=64bit on 64 systems)

*06/12/31:
   * Update window scroll action (and direction) on reconfigure (Mark)
   * Update toolbar visibility on reconfigure (Mark)

*06/12/28:

   * Allow focus to revert to stuck windows (Mark)

*06/12/27:
   * Don't assume "Jump" and "*Hidden" say "yes" in apps file (Mark)
   * Jump to autogrouped windows on another workspace if set to do so in
     apps file (Mark)

*06/12/20:
   * Fixed a few bugs with tabbed windows on restart (Mark)

*06/12/19:
   * Little simplification of data structure for keybindings (Mark)
     Side effects:
     - "Mod4 a b" now behaves like "Mod4 a None b" -- in fact, "None" is now
       completely obsolete
     - You can press "Escape" to cancel any Emacs-style keychain in progress
       (unless it's bound to something else)
     - If there is a conflict between bindings, the first one in the file wins
     - Fixes handling of keychains like "Mod4 a Mod1 b"
     - Should fix some issues with "None" modifier

*06/12/18:
   * Rotate items in toolbar the same way as tabs (Mark)

*06/12/17:
   * Stop cycling focus when any other command is run, e.g. bug #1595336 (Mark)

*06/12/16:
   * Remove useless stuff from code that reloads configuration (Mark)

   * fixed little issue in fbsetbg (Mathias)

     to install a wpsetter .. which she doenst want

*06/08/02:
   * Rename session.screen*.iconbar.deiconifyMode to
     session.screen*.userFollowModel (Mark)
     This resource is used for:
     - clicking a window on a different workspace in the iconbar
     - _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages where the source is a pager
     - clicking a client in the workspace menu (and the opposite is used for
       right clicks)

*06/07/27:
   * Don't change the order of creating windows with transients on restart.

     #1449608)
     Workspace.cc
   * New windows don't steal focus from fullscreen windows; instead, flash the
     titlebar and iconbar button (Mark)
     Window.cc
*06/07/03:
   * fix+improve handling of window gravity, was very broken (Simon)
     - caused (among others) windows with gravity set to get relocated 
       on close.
     - gravity is now taken into account on style change
   * make our default locale, init, menu, and style paths properly
     expand PREFIX in the make install stage, so that make prefix=elsewhere
     works properly (Simon)
     configure.in

-----------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 1.0rc2:

*06/07/03:

*06/06/25:
   * Fix [ 1512046 ] "window.label.unfocus.pixmap" doesn't update (Simon)
     - FbPixmap::copy was keeping the same pixmap if they had same 
       dimensions. This effectively broke the image cache.
   * Explicitly map NoSymbol to keycode 0 (thanks Julien Trolet)
     (seems to be assigned to several keycodes)
   * Menu aware of text encodings (Simon)
     - new menu file options: 
         [encoding] {CODESET}
           ...
         [endencoding]
     - All distributions are encouraged to use these inside any 
       auto-generated menu files, so that they are independent of user 
       encoding.
     - Encoding defaults to user's current encoding
   * Fix crash when unable to convert between local and utf-8 encodings (Simon)
   * Fix DetachClient key command so new window is visible (Mark)

*06/06/24:
   * Make Urgency Hint flash the correct tab in a group (Mark)

   * Fix bug #1362463, menu selection pixmaps disappear (Simon)
     - pixmap from image cache was put into FbPixmap, which freed it.

*06/06/23:
   * Make startfluxbox aware of --program-prefix and --program-suffix (Mark)

*06/06/22:
   * new Resource: session.modKey: <modkey> (thanks Jim Ramsay i dot am at jimramsay dot com)
     new Command: SetModKey <modkey>
     eg: session.modKey: Mod4   allows to use the winkey to resize and move
     windows and have Mod1 (Alt) free for using blender or Maya.

*06/06/21:
   * Fix de_DE translation (thanks Michael Bueker)
   * Fix nls (Simon)
     - file location was wrong. nls wouldn't have worked, why did no-one say? 
     - Messages output on stdout/err now properly in local encoding
     - Check for existence of catalog file, if it doesn't exist, and we can
       convert from UTF-8, try loading that one instead.
     - bunch of files changed due to macro name change:
       + Use _FB_XTEXT if the text will go out to X (for X fonts)
       + Use _FB_CONSOLETEXT if the text will go to console (stdout/err)
     - add tab options and some other missing bits to C translation

*06/06/20:
   * Fix window placement when apps remembers size but not location (Simon)

*06/06/19:
   * Add EUC-KR to ko_KR encodings (Simon)
   * Try ignoring NotifyUngrab EnterNotify events for focus (Simon)
     - should fix incorrect focus reverts when menus etc closed with 
       mouse focus, but possibly have side effects, do tell...)
   * Fix menu placement issue with (vertical) xinerama (Simon)
     - note, doesn't fix "submenus open on wrong screen" issue, that requires
       some more serious data movement.
   * Fix bug #1507671, clock not updating on multiple screens (Simon)
     - time() and gettimeofday() are inconsistent, only use gettimeofday
     - clean up Timer stuff a bit, fixed some other bugs

*06/06/18:
   * Fixed bug #1507754 iconbar text was not updated to match titlebar (Henrik)
   * Added support for _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG and _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS (Henrik)
   * Updated german translation (Thanks Michael Bueker m.bueker at berlin de)

-------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 1.0rc:

*06/06/11:
   * Added support for _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE (Henrik)

     This make apps, that support this hint, flash the titlebar and iconbar
     when they want attention.
     For example gaim.
     (Thanks Mark Tiefenbruck)

*06/06/10:
   * Added new command: ToggleCmd
     Works like a macro but executes the commands one at the time in order.
     Example:
     Mod1 T :ToggleCmd {Exec xterm} {NextWindow}
     When Mod1 T is press the first time it will start xterm, the second time
     it will do NextWindow. When it reaches end it will start at the beginning.
     (Thanks Mark Tiefenbruck)
   * Fixed resize box bug.
     The text used to determine the size used space, which could have
     different width than characters on some fonts.
     (Thanks Thanks Scott Kuhl)
   * Pressing shift while pressing enter in menu item will fake a 
     right mouse button press. Usefull when inc/decrease alpha/size in menu. 
     (Thanks Mark Tiefenbruck)
   * Added docs for session.titlebar.left/right.
     Added docs about middle click on workspace menu.
     Improved danish translation.
     (Thanks Jonas Koelker)
   * Fix building on machines without iconv [sf.net #1499402] (Simon)

     to codesets (Simon)
     *** Please report any oddness (Esp regressions) in native text
     - Makefile.am can now specify several target codesets
     - generated-*.m files are automatically generated, but not on 
       every build, only on new additions.
     - I18N::getMessage now returns FbString's
     - Menu labels are passed as FbString&e s, not char *s.

*06/05/17:
   * Fix transparency on multiple screens & possibly bad root bg atom
     reading (Simon)

*06/05/16:
   * Fix bug with horizontal maximisation when quadrant resizing (Mathias)

*06/05/13:
   * Fixed some title redraw issues (Thanks Mark Tiefenbruck)
   * Added support for _NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION . (Henrik)
     When this state is set fluxbox will start flashing 
     the titlebar and button in the toolbar. It will stop when the window
     is focused.
     The blink rate can be configured with the following resource:
     session.screen0.demandsAttentionTimeout: <timeout in milliseconds>
     Default value is 500.
     If the value is zero this feature will be disabled.

*06/05/07:
   * Handle EMWH window and icon titles, plus localise workspace names (Simon)
     - FbTk::FbWindow::textProperty now handles utf8 type, and always 
       returns UTF-8 encoded strings (for internal use)
   * Handle UTF-8 strings properly (Simon)
     - still need to integrate EWMH strings properly (they are utf8)
     - still need to fix up TextBox

*06/05/01:
   * Make apps file keywords case insensitive, plus reload it (if newer)
     before save on close and remember menu events (Simon)

*06/04/26:
   * Fix resizing of client window when autogroup from apps (Simon)

*06/04/25:

     #1475268 (thanks Scott Kuhl; skuhl AT cs utah edu)
   * fbrun: Move the cursor to the end when tab completing
     (Simon + thanks Jonas Koelker), sf.net rfe #1333003, patch #1475578
   * Fix up comments for doxygen (Thanks Jonas Koelker)
   * Output the error message on fallback restart execs (sf patch#1475213)
     (Thanks Jonas Kölker, jonaskoelker at users.sourceforge.net).

   * Use -Wall when --enable-debug and some warning fixes 
     (Simon + thanks Jonas Koelker)
   * Fix memory leaks & other errors in Menu code (Simon)
   * Use external tabs by default (Simon)
     - they provide a unique look to fluxbox
     - backwards compatible with 0.1.14 ("stable")
     - new users will wonder what they are :)

*06/04/23:
   * Fixed typos in new docs (thanks Semushin Slava)
   * Added support for _NET_WM_ALLOWED_ACTIONS and all the _NET_WM_ACTION_*,

   * Cosmetics to Workspace.hh CurrentWindowCmd.cc

*06/04/21:

   * php_coder tells me that the nb_NO patch was somewhat broken
     Revert it for now, pending another update ... (Simon)
   * Update all transparent things when bg changes (Simon)

     (thanks Geoff Lywood - glywood at users.sourceforge.net)
   * Fix some rotated toolbar+textbutton issues (Simon)

       session.screen0.reversewheeling: true|false
     (thanks Kalle - ice_jkpg at users.sourceforge.net)
   * Missing space in translation (thanks... anonymous, sf.net #1455024)
   * Set (take|send)to(next|prev)workspace offset default value to 1
     instead of the current 0 (which makes them look non-functional).
     Similarly for tab and (|next|prev|left|right)workspace.
     - Thanks Jonas Koelker (sf.net 1467926)
   * Add "CloseAllWindows" key binding 
     (thanks Adriano Dal Bosco - adbosco at users.sourceforge.net)
     - Useful to trigger all "close" actions before flux exit (or other)
       to catch any pending file saves etc...
   * Fix all warnings with (gcc 3.4.6) -Wall, mainly sign comparisons (Simon)
   * signedness fix in Container moveItem (thanks Mark Tiefenbruck)

   * Fix updating of button state (esp stick/shade)  (Simon)
     (sf.net #1281724, #1213257)

*06/04/13:
   * Provide "Key Modes" (Thanks Mark Tiefenbruck, mark at tiefenbruck dot org)
     - New action in keys file:
         Modifier Key :Keymode <Name> <End Modifier> <End Key>
       Will define a keybinding namespace activated by the given mod/key 
       combination. The End Modifier and key are optional. They define 
       the key combination that quits the given key mode. They default 
       to just 'Escape'.
     - New keys file optional prefix:
         <Name>: Modifier Key :Command
       will only work when the <Name> keymode is activated.
     - <Name> is  "default" if not specified - so:
        **default commands will not be activated inside another keymode**
     - Handy Example:
        Mod1 X :KeyMode XNest
        XNest: Mod1 X :KeyMode default
       Will switch to XNest keymode when you press Alt-X. Then the 
       default bindings will not be caught by normal fluxbox, and will 
       pass through to an Xnested one! Groovy... Alt-X will switch back 
       to normal.

*06/04/11:
   * Ensure applying of size hints while maximizing (Mathias)
   * Fix calculation of prevWorkspace (Mathias)
   * Cosmetic, close #1467926 (thanx Jonas Koelker)

*06/04/09:
   * Fix label background update with external tabs (Simon)

*06/04/06:
   * Fix build on amd64 - some more size_t propagation and includes 
    (Simon)

*06/04/05:
   * Fix gcc 2.95.4 build error in ScreenPlacement.hh (Simon)
   * Fix tabs on other workspaces being shown on placement change (Simon)
     + Fix XmbFonts for multiple screens. Still need to fix XFontImp, 
       it's quite a bit more convoluted.

*06/04/04:
   * Rotated Xmb Fonts (Simon)
     - rotated when drawn. Probably not very efficient for 
       parentrelative backgrounds. If it proves an issue, we should 
       probably cache recently-drawn strings so we can just re-stipple.
   * Rotated X Fonts again, plus minor external tab alignment fixes (Simon)
     - Still need to do XmbFonts. Most people probably load those 
       instead of XFont these days. Will need yet another approach...

*06/04/02:
   * size_t fixes. (Thanks Semushin Slava aka php-coder)

*06/03/27:
   * Fix crash when deiconifying stuck windows with Follow mode (Simon)
   * Don't Follow stuck windows on deiconify, since they're stuck 
     (thanks Mark Tiefenbruck)

*06/03/26:
   * Related to external (Simon)
     - Fix title alignment
     - Fix "jumpy" vertical tabs on tab size change & other change-related
     - Fix alignment error for left-hand vertical tabs
   * More external tabs work AND rotated Xft text (Simon)
     - new tab positions (LeftTop, LeftBottom, etc)
     - TextButtons and Containers can have orientation set on them
     - XftFonts store all rotated versions (if used), 
       so the theme doesn't need to know about it. Pixmaps are also auto-rotated.
     - TODO: Update XFontImp rotation code
     - Note: many files touched because constness removed from many fonts

*06/03/24:
   * Fix compile error in Theme.cc (sf.net bug #1454204)
   * Fixed apps filename on save (Thanks mal at komcept com)

*06/03/23:
   * Fixed duplicate ClickToFocus menu item (Thanks Mark Tiefenbruck)
   * Fix some tab stacking alignment and rendering on tab resize (Simon)
     (and very minor tidying)

*06/03/22:
   * More external tabs work (Simon)
     - Can now be placed TopLeft/TopRight/BottomLeft/BottomRight
     - New "Tab Options" config menu, with (efficient) runtime updating
     - New tab.width config option to control external tab width
     - edge snapping includes tabs
     - decoration fixes where some missed the tab option
     - label text color was not updated

*06/03/20:
   * Fixed some minor typos (Thanks Semushin Slava)
   * Fix placement config (some compilers resulted in ignoring of 
     placement policy setting), and a minor ext. tabs placement bug
   * External tabs (Simon)
     - option in Configure menu to enable
       - restart require at present when toggling this option
     - New apps pnemonic for "Deco" option: TAB, which is like NONE, 
       but with an external tab
     Notes:
     - tab width currently hardcoded
     - only alignment is topleft

-------------------------------------------------------------

      background: <texture option>
      background.pixmap: <image filename>
      background.color: <color>
      background.colorTo: <color>
     The background.pixmap filename will be sent to "fbsetbg"
     which in turn sets the background.
     The following options will be available for the background.pixmap:
       - tiled 
       - centered
     For example:
       background: tiled
       background.pixmap: someimage.png
     and it can also generate a normal texture:
       background: gradient
       background.color: blue
       background.colorTo: green
     The rootCommand in the style is now obsolete and
     if the "background" item is not found in the style then the default
     background will be black and with a warning text.
     (Henrik)

*05/11/16:

       - set the action that happens when scrolling on the titlebar
       session.screenN.windowScrollReverse: true|false
       - reverse the action direction

*05/09/04:
   * Added Feature Request #1084510 (Mathias)
     When Mod1 + LeftMouse are clicked on a Window and the mouse is not
     moved, the window is raised at LeftMouseRelease

*05/09/03:
   * Exchanged the hardcoded 3200 pixel limit for texture size to

    Fix for #1240248, Segfaults for :MoveTabLeft/Right (Mathias)

*05/07/20:
    Changed some *Focus options (Mathias)
    removed SloppyFocus, SemiSloppyFocus and ClickToFocus options
    added MouseFocus, ClickFocus, MouseTabFocus, ClickTabFocus
    - MouseFocus - change the focus to the window under the mouse
      (almost similar to the 'old' SloppyFocus)
    - ClickFocus - change the focus to the window the user clicks
    - MouseTabFocus - change active tabclient to the one under the
      mouse in titlebar, does NOT change the focus
    - ClickTabFocus - change active tabclient when clicked onto a
      tabbutton
    to achieve former SemiSloppyFocus behavior one needs MouseFocus and
    ClickTabFocus

*05/07/13:
    Dragging a tab button from current titlebar onto current client area will
    detach that client (Mathias)

*05/07/12:
    Renaming of 'bsetroot' to 'fbsetroot' (Mathias)
    blackbox's 'bsetroot' and fluxbox's 'bsetroot' have different syntax

*05/06/28:
  * Fix for toggling the toolbar doesnt update strut (thanx C. Monti)
  * Little reordering of ToolbarMenu items (Mathias)

*05/06/23:
  * Moved window menu from FluxboxWindow to BScreen, so
    we now use one window menu per screen instead of one menu per window,
    thus saving memory and increasing speed.      (Henrik)

*05/06/19:
  * Fix shaded + iconic windows + restart (Simon)
    - use ATTRIB_HIDDEN, can't use IconicState

  * Revert shaded window fix. Wrong approach and caused crashes (Simon)

*05/06/15:
  * Enhanced MoveTo, fixes #1074568 (Mathias)
      MoveTo <int|*> <int|*> <Reference Corner>
       - * means "use current value"
       - Reference Corner is one of:
         - UpperLeft, Upper, UpperRight
         - Left, Right
         - LowerLeft, Lower, Right
       examples:
         MoveTo 0 * Left       -> snap to left workspace edge
         MoveTo * 0 Lower      -> snap to lower workspace edge
         MoveTo 0 0 UpperRight -> snap to upper right workspace corner
  * Fixes #1198192, vlc to fbgm (Mathias)
  * Fixes #1213003, SendToWorkspace shouldnt follow (Mathias)
      - SendToWorkspace silently changes the workspace of the window
      - TakeToWorkspace takes the window and puts it onto the ws
  * Fixes #1216020, *.font.effect wont get cleared if not defined in style (Mathias)

*05/06/09:
  * Reordering of the WorkspaceMenu (Mathias)
    Icon submenu ontop, workspaces below, new|edit|remove on bottom

*05/06/07:
  * Fixed justification in WorkspaceNameTool #1213262 (Mathias)

*05/06/03:
  * Massive change of font handling (Mathias)
    - Usage of xft-fonts is prefered, except a font-description starts with '-'
    - Removed "antialias"-option completly, to enable/disable "antialias"
      use either  <fontname>:antialias=<bool> in the style or use
      Xft.antialias: <bool> in your .Xdefaults
    - Added new styleresources:
        *.font.effect: <halo|shadow>
        *.font.shadow.x : <int>       - shadow x offset
        *.font.shadow.y : <int>       - shadow y offset
        *.font.shadow.color : <color> - color of shadow
        *.font.halo.color : <color>   - color of halo
    - Removed 'shadow' and 'halo' options from fontdefinitions:
        !! Style authors have to update their styles !!
    - Simplified XmbFontImp to not try all possible fonts to match locale
    - Style authors may specify multiple fonts:
        <font1>|<font2>|<font3>
      if loading of font1 fails, fluxbox probes <font2>, etc. The last font is
      "fixed". Hints for style authors:
        - if xft tries to load a font it will _ALWAYS_ return a valid font,
          it doesnt have to look like the one you want to have, read more
          about it: http://fontconfig.org/fontconfig-user.html
        - export XFT_DEBUG=1  before running fluxbox helps to see
          which fonts are picked.
      eg:
          *.font: Verdana,Arial-12:antialias=true|-artwiz-snap-*-
          if fluxbox is compiled with xft this will NEVER try to
          load "-artwiz-snap-*-" since xft gives for sure a font,
          most likely Verdana or Arial but noone knows. So, if
          fluxbox has no xft support the first fontpattern fails
          and fluxbox tries the next one, which might be successful.
          if everything fails, it will use "fixed"
    - Added caching of fonts, fonts are only loaded once.
    - Fixed #1090902

*05/06/02:
  * Fixed _BLACKBOX_NOTIFY_WINDOW_ADD issue (thanx Vadim)
    _BLACKBOX_NOTIFY_WINDOW_ADD was emited before _NET_CLIENT_LIST
    and _NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKING lists updates.
  * Fixed iconified windows disappear from _NET_CLIENT_LIST (thanx Vadim)
  * Fixes for _NET* hints (Mathias + thanx Vadim)
    - _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN now correctly used
    - _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER not longer deleted from state
    - _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR not longer mixed with _HIDDEN

*05/05/27:
  * Bugfix, install directory for keys, menu, init (Thanks php-coder)
  * Belarusian language translation
   (Thanks Kirill A. Shutemov, k.shutemov at sam-solutions d0t net)

*05/05/21:
  * Keycodes can now be used in the keys file.
    Example:
    None 10 :NextWorkspace
    (10 - keycode for '1')
    Usefull for keys that have no symbol.
    (Thanks Matus Telgarsky, catachresis at cmu [d0t] edu)

*05/05/18:
  * Added new configure option --with-locale=path
    redirects location of nls directories.
    (Thanks php-coder at altlinux dot ru)

*05/05/17:
  * Fix systemtray overlap (Simon + Thanks Vadim)

*05/05/14:
  * Fix some Ewmh/Gnome issues (Mathias + thanx Vadim)
    +  _NET_CLIENT_LIST and _NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKING not updated
       when sending _BLACKBOX_NOTIFY_WINDOW_DEL
    + _NET_WM_DESKTOP and _WIN_WORKSPACE had wrong initial values (-1), which
      lead to probems with (eg) fbpager

    - Shade - just like the "Stick"-button
      Styleresources:
        window.shade.pixmap, window.shade.unfocus.pixmap, window.shade.pressed.pixmap
        window.unshade.pixmap, window.unshade.unfocus.pixmap, window.unshade.pressed.pixmap
        etc.
    - MenuIcon - click on it provides the windowmenu, if the app
      contains a pixmap (gvim, konqueror etc etc) the pixmap is displayed, a
      little menu otherwise.
      Styleresources:
        window.menuicon.pixmap, window.menuicon.unfocus.pixmap window.menuicon.pressed.pixmap
        etc.
    Example ~/.fluxbox/init - entry:
      session.titlebar.left: MenuIcon Stick
      session.titlebar.right: Shade Minimize Maximize Close
  * xrestop should now display "Fluxbox" (Simon)
  * Fix potential segfault menu bug, thanks chenfeng (Simon)
  * Added more KeyActions to TextBox (thanx to Vadim <suhanov_vadim at mail dot ru>
      Control + LeftArrow  -> Moves cursor to the left direction, up to next word.
      Control + RightArrow -> to the right direction.
      Control + BackSpace  -> Removes everything from the cursor left side, up to next left word.
      Control + Delete     -> like above but removes to the right direction.

*05/05/05:
  * Fix #1160244, #1099704, #1094107 Mutiple keyboard layout (Mathias + thanx
    to Vadim)
    Switching to a secondary/third keyboard layout via the xkb-extensions
    leads to broken NextWindow/PrevWindow and broken fbrun/CommandDialog:
    - be aware of what xkb is doing to the event.state
    - minor cleaning

*05/05/03:
  * Fix drawing of no-title menus, plus updating of int menu items (Simon)
  * Code cleaning. (Henrik)
    Fluxbox::associateClient; creates tab and
    maps WinClient to label button.

*05/05/02:
  * Added FbTk::Select2nd + more code cleaning (Henrik)
    This returns .second from operator ()(Someclass &a)
    Usefull for std::map loops.
  * Cleaning,  (Henrik)
    Create/delete tabs with FbWinFrame::createTab/removeTab

*05/04/30:
  * Fix #1086673 ArrangeWindows on shaded aterms causes inconsistency (Mathias)
    we now place shaded Windows above the normal windows. ArrangeWindows
    touches only windows on the current (xinerama)-head.

*05/04/29:
  * Added new IconbarModes:  (Mathias)
       NoIcons          - all but iconified windows
       WorkspaceNoIcons - all but iconified windows on the current ws
  * Fixed transient bug.  (Henrik)
    #1157361 inconsistent behavior of Java dialogs.
    Transients that are created before the transient_for window
    gets copied to a transient_for waiting list and when the
    transient_for window is created the transients are updated,
    When raising a transient window the window gets placed last
    in the transient list so it gets raised last and thus gets
    places above.

*05/04/28:
  * Revert Mathias's little change to my patch, and fix it properly :) (Simon)

*05/04/27:
  * Fix some initialisation, plus setting background too much (Simon + Mathias)

    the same depth as the screen (treat all as 1-bit, easy to handle)
    (Simon)
  * Fix a bunch more issues with recent patches (Simon)
    - Clock text colour on start
    - Resizing not updating in some cases
    - menu separators not being drawn
  * Close #1107216, minor fbgm-issue, cosmetic startfluxbox (from the OpenBSD patches)
  * Fix #1182770 (Mathias)
    session.screen*.workspaces: <int> and the number of
    workspaces in the running fluxbox were out of sync and lead to
    segfault on a "reloadconfig"-Command.
  * Fix drawing when transparency off (Simon)

*05/04/26:
  * Fix systray icon sizing (send a configurenotify on resize) (Simon)
  * Extension of previous patch, pushing various bits of menu items and
    text buttons onto the background, and fixing various issues (Simon)
    + Incidentally, adds some new theme items (due to backwards
      compatibility fix):
      - menu.hilite.submenu.pixmap:    <Pixmap>
      - menu.hilite.selected.pixmap:   <Pixmap>
      - menu.hilite.unselected.pixmap: <Pixmap>
    These are equivalent to the no-.hilite ones, except are shown
    when the item is highlighted...

*05/04/25:
  * Fixed #1188690, fbrun segfault (Mathias)

*05/04/23:
  * Close of #956325 (Mathias)
       WorkspaceMenu -> left click on a item will jump TO that
                        workspace
                     -> middle click will fetch it to the current
                        workspac
       SendToMenu    -> left click send it quietly
                     -> middle click send it and follows to that
                        workspace
    This should now match whats written in the manpage.
  * Fixed #960535 aka Deiconify with apps set 'sticky' (Mathias)
  * Fixed #1020399 aka broken ShowDesktop - command (Mathias)

*05/04/22:

  * Fixed iconv-issues on *BSD/MacOSX (Mathias)
  * Fixed #1133809, ArrangeWindows covers Toolbar/Slit (Mathias)

*05/04/20:
  * Fixed problem with _NET_WM_STRUT (Mathias)

*05/04/18:
  * Fixed problem with WindowSnapping (Mathias)

*05/04/15:
  * Fixed #1170056, Moving tab beyong last right tab causes malfunction (Mathias)
  * Fixed a few drawing bugs created by last patch (Simon)
    (titlebar no clear on resize, menu opening offscreen...)

*05/04/11:
  * Rework lots of stuff relating to transparency, esp menus+frame (Simon)
    + Massively reduce pixmap memory usage (view with xrestop)
    + Should also improve startup+style change times, esp for large menus
    + This introduces a few rendering bugs, but I'd like stuff tested
    + Transparency is done differently now. People shouldn't need to
      call updateTransparent.
    + Do not use persistent pixmap buffers unless you're sure!
      XSetWindowBackground already copies/buffers the set pixmap, so
      things need to be rendered to a temp pixmap once, then can be
      freed.
    Known bugs (please report others to Rathnor on #fluxbox):
     - different focus/unfocus transparency doesn't update labelbuttons
       properly. Workaround: use same transparency for both.
     - Text sometimes gets overdrawn a lot. Probably should render it to
       background using a virtual hook in FbWindow::updateBackground
     - Changing style resizes things, not all pixmaps updated properly
       Workaround: restart fluxbox after changing style
     - Probably breaks Composite support. Let me know how.
    TODO:
     + FbPixmap::getRootPixmap called very often. It should cache the
       result and watch the relevant properties.

  * added new option to specify, on which screen fluxbox should handle
    the windows. default behavior is to handle each available screen.
    closes #1159809. (Mathias)

       -screen <"all"|int[,int]>

    eg:

       $> fluxbox -screen 0,2      will run fluxbox on 0.0 and 0.2 so
                                   one can run any other wm on 0.1.
       $> fluxbox -screen all      default, fluxbox manages all screens

*05/02/04:
  * Fixed possible bug for invalid tools (Mathias)

*05/02/03:
  * Added 'revision-number' to  fluxbox -info (Mathias)

*05/01/20:
  * Close #1105048 (thanx to the openbsd-folks)
    minor issues with fluxbox-generate_menu
  * Close #1105041 (thanx to the openbsd-folks)
    execl needs NULL termination, on 64-bit-systems '0' would expand

  * Updated ko_KR - (thanx Jo Hyunseok)

*05/01/10:
  * Fix for #1087220 (WithdrawnState handling) (Mathias)
  * Fix position initialisation from apps file (Simon)

*05/01/05:
  * Tidy up initialisation a bit better. Handlers can still use "action"
    functions (e.g. stick()), but those functions should now check if
    isInitialised and only set the state variables (not send signals
    etc) if not.
  * Fix for BScreen::reassociateWindow (Mathias)
    Simon's last changes made fluxbox crash when "Sticky" or "Workspace"
    options in the apps-file where used. This fix also solves <Current> and
    <SemiFollow>-Deiconifymode for Iconbar, when Iconbar is in
    <Icons-only>-mode

    allows us to load other image-formats than just xpm, but we need
    the help of an external (popular) library for that:

       http://www.enlightenment.org/pages/imlib2.html

     to have imlib2 support, you have to ./configure --enable-imlib2

  * Cleaner code for global Font- and Imagestuff (Mathias)

  * Fix rendering of transparency on menu exposes (Simon)

      This is kind of experimental. Backing store is off by default
      in XF86-4. If you want to play, add: Option "BackingStore"  "yes"
      to the Screen section in your XF86Config file. And let me know
      how it goes :) It basically means we don't have to refresh

    but with some special menu items:
    [iconify], [maximize], [shade], [close], [extramenus]
    [layer], [sendto]
    + the all the other menu items that you can use in the normal
      root menu (i.e [exec] (aterm) {aterm})
    The [extramenus] will add  "remember" menu
    example: session.screen0.windowMenu: ~/.fluxbox/windowmenu
        [begin]
        [exec] (aterm) {aterm}
        [maximize]
        [shade]
        [stick]
        [submenu] (advanced)
           [layer]
           [sendto]

               window leads to attaching to that frame

    This will allow you to add key bindings while you're running fluxbox
    in the Fluxbox Command dialog.
    example:
    BindKey Mod1 R :RootMenu
    The key will add itself to the keys file, to remove keys you still
    have to manualy edit the keys file until there's a better save
    in the code.

*03/12/19:
  * Added Edit Clock Format menu item  (Henrik)
    This allow the user to edit the clock format without open

    SetResourceValueCmd <resourcename> <resource value>
    SetResourceValueDialog
    These will help the user to set some resources that doesn't have

    The new action for editing workspace name is:

  * New Action: CommandDialog - with this action you'll get a dialog much like  (Henrik)
    fbrun but in this you can issue fluxbox actions like NextWorkspace and so on.
  * Replaces WorkspaceNameEditing with a more generic dialog  (Henrik)
    CommandDialog.
  * Code cleaning (Henrik)

    session.screen0.menuDelayClose: 300

*03/12/15:
  * Fix mozilla focus issue (Simon)
    - When input focus hint not present assume false rather than true

*03/12/13:
  * Moving client to drop zone when drag'n'drop to root window (Henrik)

*03/12/12:
  * Added menu delay/click to open or close submenus (Henrik)
    In menuMode: Click you need to click on the menu item to open it.
    The menuDelay is the delay to open an submenu.
    The menuDelayClose is so you don't need to aim that much when
    you're moving the cursor to the submenu, over the item below
    or above, so it stays visible.
    new resource items:
    session.screen0.menuMode:  can be either Click or Delay (default: Delay)
    session.screen0.menuDelay:  in msec  (default: 0 )
    session.screen0.menuDelayClose: in msec (default: 0 )
    example:
    session.screen0.menuMode: Delay
    session.screen0.menuDelay: 400
    session.screen0.menuDelayClose: 300
    Notice how the menuDelay is a bit larger than menuCloseDelay
    this is so the previous menu can close before you open the next
  * Fixed bug when adding alot of new workspaces (Henrik)
  * Removed Next/Prev client from window menu (Henrik)
  * Added aligment for buttons in iconbar (Henrik)
    Change Left, Relative or Right via the Iconbar mode menu

            [end]
    and inside the { } is the relative position
    possible values for () are:
    UPPERLEFT, UPPERRIGHT, LOWERLEFT, LOWERRIGHT, CENTER, WINCENTER
    Remember.cc/hh

  * Ignore NotifyInferior focus changes (Simon)
    - trying to pin down various focus issues... does this help/hinder?
  * New theme items: (Simon)
    window.label.active:   <texture>
    window.label.active.textColor:  <color>
    For highlighting the active (visible) tab when not in focus.

    a new -U option which does the same    thing without remembering

    Changed switch -a to -na (disable antialias)

*03/11/29:
  * Added shadow text (Henrik)
    To use shadow in text you need to add option to your font style item.
    The theme item will continue to work in old fluxbox and it'll just
    ignore the "shadow" option
    Example:
    menu.title.font: Verdana-10:bold,shadow
    menu.frame.font: Verdana-8:shadow
    window.font: sans-8:shadow
    *.font: sans-12:shadow

    - allows us to remove some dodgy "and for parent" hacks (not done in
      this patch, but will be in new action system which depends on this)
    - clientarea still exists for future implementation of improved
      sizing, particularly to provide a backing to clients that don't
      take up the whole area.
