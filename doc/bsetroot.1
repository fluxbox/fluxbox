.BR bsetroot " \-help"
.br
.B bsetroot
.RI "[ \-display " display " ] \-solid " color
.br
.B bsetroot
.RI "[ \-display " display " ] \-mod " "x y" " \-fg " color " \-bg " color
.br
.B bsetroot
.RI "[ \-display " display " ] \-gradient " texture " \-from " color " \-to " color
.SH DESCRIPTION
Bsetroot is a utility that can control the appearance of the root window in
three ways: Either give it a solid color, or write a two color modula pattern
to it, or render a gradient texture, based on two different colors.
.PP
Bsetroot resembles
.IR xsetroot (1)
in this functionality but it supports multiple screen displays, and gradient
textures the same way as Blackbox does.
It doesn't handle cursors etc.
Bsetroot is part of the Blackbox package.
.SH OPTIONS
Bsetroot operates in three ways, you must choose one of the first 3 options:
.TP
.BI \-solid " color"
Sets the root window to specified color.
.TP
.BI \-mod " x y"
Creates a modula pattern. You must specify
.BR \-bg " and " \-fg
colors.
.TP
.BI \-gradient " texturestring"
Renders the specified texture string to the root window.
For possible texture strings, please refer to
.IR blackbox (1).
You must also specify both a
.BR \-from " and a " \-to
color.
.TP
.BI \-display " display"
Tells Bsetroot to connect to the specified display.
.TP

Background color.
Needed for
.B \-mod
patterns.
.TP
.BI "\-fg, \-foreground " color
Foreground color.
Needed for
.B \-mod
patterns.
.TP
