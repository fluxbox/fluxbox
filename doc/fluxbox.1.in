.SH "NAME"
fluxbox \- A lightweight window manager for the X Windowing System
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBfluxbox\fR [\-rc \fIrcfile\fR] [\-no\-slit] [\-no\-toolbar] [\-log \fIlogfile\fR] [\-display \fIdisplay\fR] [\-screen all|\fIscr\fR,\fIscr\fR\&...] [\-verbose] [\-sync]
.sp
\fBfluxbox\fR [\-v | \-version] | [\-h | \-help] | [\-i | \-info] | [\-list\-commands]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBfluxbox(1)\fR is a window manager\&. As such it provides configurable window decorations, a root menu to launch applications and a toolbar that shows the current workspace name, a set of application names and the current time\&. There is also a workspace menu to add or remove workspaces\&.
.sp
Fluxbox can iconify (or minimize) windows to the toolbar One click and they reappear\&. A double\-click on the titlebar of the window will \fIshade\fR it; i\&.e\&. the window will disappear, and only the titlebar will remain visible\&.
.sp
There are also two areas commonly used by small applets: the \(oqslit\(cq can be used to dock small applications; e\&.g\&. most of the \(lqbbtools\(rq and \(lqWindow Maker dockapps\(rq can use the slit, and the \(oqsystray\(cq which lives in the toolbar supports standard system tray icons provided by some applications\&.
.sp
Fluxbox uses its own graphics class to render its images on the fly\&. By using style files, you can determine in great detail how your desktop looks\&. fluxbox styles are compatible with those of Blackbox 0\&.65 or earlier versions, so users migrating can still use their current favourite themes\&.
.sp
Most of the default keyboard and mouse button actions mentioned in this manual can be changed and configured in the \(oqkeys\(cq file\&. This powerful configuration file can also be used to automate almost any action you may want to perform, from launching applications to moving windows around the screen\&. See \fBfluxbox\-keys(5)\fR for details\&.
.sp
Fluxbox can also remember certain attributes of individual application windows and restore these settings the next time the window opens\&. See the \fBfluxbox\-apps(5)\fR for details\&.
.sp
Fluxbox supports the majority of the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH) specification, as well as numerous other Window Hinting standards\&. This allows all compliant window managers to provide a common interface to standard features used by applications and desktop utilities\&.

.SH "STARTING FLUXBOX"
.sp
\fBfluxbox(1)\fR comes with a program called \fBstartfluxbox(1)\fR usually located wherever you installed fluxbox\&. This script provides you with many options and variables that can be set when starting fluxbox\&. To actually call fluxbox and begin using it, you should place \(lqexec startfluxbox\(rq in your \fB~/\&.xinitrc\fR as the last executed command\&. This is assuming that the location of \fBfluxbox(1)\fR and \fBstartfluxbox(1)\fR are in your shell\(cqs $PATH\&. Also note that you may need to create the \fB~/\&.xinitrc\fR file or your setup may use \fB~/\&.xsession\fR instead, depending on your X setup\&. Some X login managers like \fBgdm(1)\fR or \fBkdm(1)\fR may simply provide a \(lqFluxbox\(rq session for you without having to alter any settings\&.
.sp
By using fluxbox \-i you\(cqll see the defaults used by \fBfluxbox(1)\fR\&. These are what fluxbox looks for upon startup\&. In the list of \(lqDefaults:\(rq you\(cqll see a menu file location, this is where you can provide a system\-wide menu file for your users\&.
.sp
On exit or restart, fluxbox will save user defaults in the file \fB~/\&.fluxbox/init\fR\&. Resources in this file can also be edited by hand, see the \fBRESOURCES\fR section for more details\&. \fBfluxbox(1)\fR also has many tools to edit these; look through the main menu once fluxbox has started to find different ways of managing your session\&.
.SH "USING FLUXBOX"
.sp
When using fluxbox for the first time, users who are more accustomed to full desktop environments such as KDE or Gnome may be a little surprised by the minimal screen content\&. fluxbox is designed to be fast and powerful, so it may take a bit of getting used to \(em however, the rewards are worthwhile\&.
.sp
In this section, we\(cqll give a quick summary of the common things\&. However, we recommend that you consult the referenced sections of this manual to further develop your understanding of what you can do with fluxbox\&.
.SS "Root Window (Main)"
.sp
Looking at the fluxbox desktop immediately after startup you\(cqll generally see only one thing: the toolbar\&. If you right\-click (mouse button 3) somewhere on the desktop, you can access the Root Menu\&. A middle\-click (mouse button 2) on the desktop shows you the Workspace Menu\&.
.SS "Root Menu and Workspace Menu"
.sp
From the RootMenu you can launch applications and configure fluxbox\&. The WorkspaceMenu shows all windows and on which workspaces they are\&. See section \fBMENUS\fR on how to customize these menus\&.
.SS "Toolbar"
.sp
The toolbar contains any combination of the following tools, by default in this order:
.sp

\fBClock\fR: Date and Time
.RE
.sp
The contents and behavior of the toolbar can be configured, see the \fBTOOLBAR\fR section for details\&.
.SS "Slit"
.sp
Initially you won\(cqt be able to see the slit\&. It is there, but it isn\(cqt being used yet, which confuses some people initially\&. Think of it as a dock where you can place smaller programs\&. If you\(cqve looked at any screenshots on the official fluxbox web site, you will have noticed some small programs on the edge of some of the screens\&. These were more than likely docked programs in the slit\&. To learn more about the slit, we have an entire \fBSLIT\fR section below that goes into detail about the options you have\&.
.SS "Layers"
.sp
fluxbox manages the following layers (from highest to lowest):

.RE
.sp
Windows on a higher layer will always appear above those on a lower one\&. These layers can be used on application windows, the slit or the toolbar\&. You can assign applications to a certain layer by specifying it in the \(oqapps\(cq file or through the WindowMenu\&. We discuss the \(oqapps\(cq file in \fBfluxbox\-apps(5)\fR\&. We discuss the WindowMenu in the \fBMENUS\fR section\&. We discuss layers in more detail in the \fBLAYERS\fR section\&.
.SS "Focus Model"
.sp
The window that has the focus is the one that receives key and mouse events\&. The focus model is selectable via the Configuration menu located in the root menu\&. We\(cqll discuss the different types of focus below in the \fBFOCUS MODEL\fR section\&.
.SS "Windows"
.sp
A left\-click (mouse button 1) on any part of the window\(cqs border will raise it\&. Dragging then moves the window to another part of the desktop\&. A right click and drag on the border resizes the window\&. Dragging the resize grips at the left and right bottom corners also will resize the window\&. Middle clicking on a border or titlebar will immediately lower the window\&. Right clicking on the titlebar opens the Window menu\&. The commands unique to this menu are discussed in detail in the \fBWindow Menu\fR section\&.
.SS "Tabs"
.sp
fluxbox allows windows to be \(oqgrouped\(cq by middle clicking and holding on a window\(cqs tab and dragging it onto another window\&. This \(oqtabbing\(cq allows you to put multiple applications in one location on the desktop and do several operations (for example, moving or resizing) to all windows in the group\&. By default, tabs are located just above the window, but they may be embedded in the titlebar or moved to other locations on the outside of the window\&. Configuration is discussed in TAB OPTIONS section\&.
.sp
You can also set up automatic grouping using the \(oqapps\(cq file\&. See \fBGROUP SECTIONS\fR in \fBfluxbox\-apps(5)\fR for details\&.
.SS "Key Bindings"
.sp
There are a number of key bindings set up by default, which can be configured and extended to just about anything you can imagine with the keyboard\&. See \fBfluxbox\-keys(5)\fR for details on how to do this\&.
.sp
The default bindings set up by fluxbox are as follows:

.SH "MENUS"
.sp
fluxbox provides a popup menu facility that is used by a few different types of native menus\&.
.sp
When a menu is open, you can click on items with the mouse to activate them\&. Some special menu items react slightly differently depending on the mouse button you use, but normally you will want to use a left\-click (button 1)\&.
.sp
You can also use the the keyboard arrow key to navigate, or even type the first few letters of the item\(cqs label to select it, and \(lqenter\(rq to activate the item\&.
.sp
Normally activating a menu item should close the menu\&. You can also right\-click the title are of a menu or press \(lqesc\(rq to close it without activating an item\&.
.SS "Root Menu"

.SH "FOCUS MODEL"

The Focus Model defines how windows gain focus (i\&.e\&. become the active window, which receives keyboard and mouse events)\&. The focus model can be changed in the configuration menu (usually located under \fIfluxbox menu\fR in the Root Menu\&.
.sp
There are two main aspects of the focus model: how windows gain focus and how tabs gain focus\&. Each of these has two options: focus follows mouse and click to focus\&. Focus follows mouse means that windows will gain focus when the mouse hovers over them\&. Click to focus means that windows will gain focus when the mouse clicks on them\&.
.sp
Thus, there are four main options when choosing a focus model\&. You should choose one of the first two and one of the last two\&. They are:

.SH "STYLES"
.sp
fluxbox enables you to use specialized files that contain \fBX(1)\fR resources to specify colors, textures, pixmaps and fonts, and thus the overall look of your window borders, menus and the toolbar\&.
.sp
The default installation of fluxbox provides some of these style files\&. See \fBfluxbox\-style(5)\fR to accommodate the growing number of style components\&.
.SS "Style Overlay"
.sp
In addition to the style file, the overlay file, whose location is specified by \fBsession\&.screen0\&.styleOverlay\fR (default: \fB~/\&.fluxbox/overlay\fR) can be used to set style resources that override all styles\&. For more information about which parts of fluxbox can be controlled by the overlay file, see \fBfluxbox\-style(5)\fR\&.
.SH "THE SLIT"
.sp
The slit is a special fluxbox window frame that can contain dockable applications, such as \(lqbbtools\(rq or \(lqwindow maker dockapps\(rq\&.
.sp
When applications are run in the slit they have no window borders of their own; instead they are framed in the slit, and they are always visible in the current workspace\&.
.sp
Most dockable applications use the \-w option to run in the slit\&. For example, you could put in your \fB~/\&.fluxbox/startup\fR:
.sp

.\}
.nf
bbmail \-w &
bbpager \-w &

\fB~/\&.fluxbox/slitlist\fR\&. See the next section for details\&.
.RE
.SS "Slitlist File"
.sp
fluxbox\(cqs slitlist file is available for those that use dockapps in the slit\&. This file helps fluxbox keep track of the \fBorder\fR of the dockapps when in the slit\&. The file is generally located at \fB~/\&.fluxbox/slitlist\fR\&.
.sp
A simple procedure for getting the slit sequences the way you like it is: 1\&. Run fluxbox with no pre\-loaded dockapps 2\&. Run dockapps individually in the order you want them 3\&. Add dockapps to your \fBstartfluxbox(1)\fR script
.sp
This sequence will be saved by default to \fB~/\&.fluxbox/slitlist\fR and will be remembered for future instances of fluxbox\&.
.sp
Users are free to manually edit the slitlist file\&. It is a simple list of window names, as given by \fBxprop(1)\fR, one per dockapp\&. Similar to the init file it should not be edited while fluxbox is running\&. Otherwise changes may get overwritten\&.
.sp
The user also has the option of choosing a different path for the slitlist file, by setting the \fBsession\&.session0\&.slitlistFile\fR resource\&.
.SH "LAYERS"

Layers affect the way that windows will overlap each other on the screen\&. Windows on a higher layer will always appear above those on a lower one, whether they are focused or not\&. Fluxbox uses 13 layers, starting from 1 (highest)\&.
.sp
There are two ways to assign a window to a different layer\&. When the window is open, you may select the layer in the \(oqLayer \&...\(cq submenu of the window menu\&. The menu gives six choices for the layer, which fluxbox manages by name\&. The names are (from highest to lowest layer):
