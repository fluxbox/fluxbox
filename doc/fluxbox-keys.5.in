.SH "NAME"
fluxbox-keys \- keyboard shortcuts configuration for fluxbox(1)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
~/\&.fluxbox/keys
.SH "SYNTAX"
.sp
Variable parameters are shown in emphasis: \fIargument\fR
.sp
Optional parameters are shown in square brackets: [\fIargument\fR]
.sp
All other characters shown are required verbatim\&. Whitespace is required where shown, but it is fine to add more whitespace\&.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The keys file defines the keyboard shortcuts for \fIfluxbox(1)\fR\&.
.sp
You can customize fluxbox\(cqs key handling through the ~/\&.fluxbox/keys file\&. The file consists of lines of the basic format:
.sp
\fB[\fR\fB\fImodifiers\fR\fR\fB] \fR\fB\fIkey\fR\fR\fB :\*(Aqcommand\*(Aq [\fR\fB\fIarguments\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fI\&...\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.sp
The space between the \fIkey\fR and the \fB:\fR before the \fIcommand\fR is mandatory\&.
.sp
All modifiers and commands are case\-insensitive\&. Some command arguments (especially those that will be passed to the shell) are case\-sensitive\&. Some key names are case\-sensitive\&.
.sp
Lines beginning with a \fI#\fR or \fI!\fR are considered comments and are unread by fluxbox\&.
.sp
You will need to \(lqreload\(rq fluxbox after editing the keys file so it picks up your change\&.
.SH "MODIFIERS"
.sp
You can get a list of possible modifiers by calling \(oqxmodmap \-pm\(cq\&. This also shows you to which keys the modifiers are mapped, but the following modifiers are most commonly used:
.sp
\fBShift Control Mod1 Mod4\fR
.sp
where \fBMod1\fR is the Alt key on the PC keyboard and \fBMod4\fR is usually a key branded with a familiar company logo\&.
.PP
There are also some special modifiers that refer to mouse button events
.RS 4
.PP
\fBOnDesktop\fR
.RS 4
The mouse cursor is over the desktop (root window), and not any window\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBOnToolbar\fR
.RS 4
The mouse cursor is over the toolbar (which is normally at the bottom of the screen)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBOnWindow\fR
.RS 4
The mouse cursor is over a window\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBOnTitlebar\fR
.RS 4
The mouse cursor is over a window\(cqs titlebar\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBOnTab\fR
.RS 4
The mouse cursor is over a tab\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDouble\fR
.RS 4
Limits this action to double\-clicks only\&.
.RE
.RE
.SS "Combining Modifiers"
.sp
To combine two or more modifiers, just list them (space\-delimited) in any order\&.
.SH "KEYS"
.sp
You may specify a key by its key name (for example, \fBa\fR or \fBspace\fR) or by its numeric keycode (for example, \fB38\fR or \fB0xf3\fR)\&.
.sp
If you don\(cqt know the name of a key, you can run \fBxev(1)\fR in a terminal, push the key, and see the name in the output\&. If you have some "special" keys that do not produce a key name in the output of \fBxev(1)\fR, you can just use the keycode (NOT the keysym!) in your keys file\&.
.sp
Commands can also be bound to mouse events (\fIN\fR denotes the number of the button, eg\&. \fI1\fR is the primary button, \fI4\fR/\fI5\fR are the wheel buttons):
.PP
\fBMouseN\fR
.RS 4
The mouse button
\fIN\fR
is pressed down and held\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBClickN\fR
.RS 4
The mouse button
\fIN\fR
is clicked (pressed and released with no movement in between)
.RE
.PP
\fBMoveN\fR
.RS 4
The mouse button
\fIN\fR
is currently held, the bound action is triggered as often as the mouse moves\&.
.RE
.sp
There are some special "keys" that let you bind events to non\-keyboard events:
.PP
\fBChangeWorkspace\fR
.RS 4
Fires when the workspace changes\&. This can be used to change backgrounds or do anything else you like when you switch to a new workspace\&. See the
\fBEXAMPLES\fR
below for one idea\&.
.RE
.if n \{\
.sp
.\}
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBWarning\fR
.ps -1
.br
.sp
Use caution with this event! For example, do NOT bind this to any action that changes your current workspace\&. If you break your fluxbox with this feature, you get to keep the pieces\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.SH "CHAINING"
.sp
Key bindings can be chained in a fashion similar to Emacs key bindings using the syntax:
.sp
\fImodifiers\-1\fR \fIkey\-1\fR \fImodifiers\-2\fR \fIkey\-2\fR :\*(Aqcommand\*(Aq [\fIarguments \&...\fR]*
.sp
To abort a chained command part\-way through typing it, press the <ESC> key\&.
.PP
\fBTo Bind CTRL+C CTRL+X (Which means, press CTRL+C then CTRL+X) to quit fluxbox\fR. 
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Control c Control x :Quit
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "KEYMODES"
.sp
A specific set of key mappings can be activated and de\-activated on\-the\-fly using what are called keymodes\&. The syntax to define a mapping in a keymode is:
.sp
\fB\fIkeymode\fR\fR\fB: \fR\fB\fImodifiers\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fIkey\fR\fR\fB :\*(Aqcommand\*(Aq [\fR\fB\fIarguments\fR\fR\fB \fR\fB\fI\&...\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.sp
Where \fIkeymode\fR is any alpha\-numeric string name\&.
.sp
When this keymode is activated (see the \fBKeyMode\fR command below), all bindings prefaced by that keymode name become active (and all other keybindings will be deactivated) until the keymode changes again\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
Some commands have multiple names which are shown below as
.RS 4
CMD1 | CMD2
.RE
.PP
Related commands have been grouped below as
.RS 4
CMD1 / CMD2
.RE
.PP
The commands are broken up into sections as follows

.RE
.PP
\fBTakeToNextWorkspace\fR [\fIoffset\fR] / \fBTakeToPrevWorkspace\fR [\fIoffset\fR]
.RS 4
Sends you along with the current window to the next or previous workspace\&. If you set
\fIoffset\fR
to a value greater than the default of
\fB1\fR, it will move you that number of workspaces ahead or behind\&. If you go beyond the end of the currently defined workspaces, it will wrap around to the other end automatically\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSendToNextWorkspace\fR [\fIoffset\fR] / \fBSendToPrevWorkspace\fR [\fIoffset\fR]
.RS 4
Identical to the "TakeTo\&..." commands, but again this sends only the window, and does not move you away from your current workspace\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSetAlpha\fR [\fIalpha\fR [\fIunfocused\-alpha\fR]]
.RS 4
Sets the alpha value of a window\&.
.sp

.RE
.PP
\fBSendToNextHead\fR [\fIoffset\fR] / \fBSendToPrevHead\fR [\fIoffset\fR]
.RS 4
Sends the current window to the next/previous display head\&. If you specify an
\fIoffset\fR
greater than
\fB1\fR, it will move the window that many heads\&. If this takes the window beyond the total number of heads, it will wrap around to the beginning\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSetXProp\fR \fIPROP=value\fR
.RS 4
Sets the xproperty
\fIPROP\fR
of the current window to
\fIvalue\fR\&. Delete the content of

\fIPROP=\fR\&.
.RE
.SS "Workspace Commands"
.sp
These commands affect the entire workspace (or "desktop" as it is sometimes called)\&.

Adds or removes a workspace from the end of the list of workspaces\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNextWorkspace\fR [\fIn\fR] / \fBPrevWorkspace\fR [\fIn\fR] / \fBRightWorkspace\fR [\fIn\fR] / \fBLeftWorkspace\fR [\fIn\fR]
.RS 4
Switch to the Next / Previous workspace\&. All versions accept an offset value
\fIn\fR, which defaults to
\fB1\fR
and refers to the number of workspaces to move at one time\&. {Next,Prev}Workspace wrap around when going past the last workspace, whereas {Right,Left}Workspace do not\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBWorkspace\fR \fInumber\fR
.RS 4
Jumps to the given workspace
\fInumber\fR\&. The first workspace is
\fB1\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNextWindow\fR [{\fIoptions\fR}] [\fIpattern\fR] / \fBPrevWindow\fR [{\fIoptions\fR}] [\fIpattern\fR]

Focuses the next / previous window in the focus list\&.
.PP
\fIoptions\fR is one or more of the following, space delimited:
.RS 4
.PP
\fBstatic\fR
.RS 4
Instead of moving in order of most\-recent focus, move in order of when the window was opened (or, the order shown in the iconbar)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBgroups\fR
.RS 4
Only include the current tab in windows with multiple tabs\&.
.RE
.sp
If
\fIpattern\fR
arguments are supplied, only windows that match all the patterns are considered \- all others are skipped\&. See the section
\fBCLIENT PATTERNS\fR
below for more information\&.
.sp
This pair of commands has a special side\-effect when the keybinding used has a modifier \- It will temporarily raise the cycled window to the front so you can see it, but if you continue holding down the modifier and press the key again (For example, keep holding "Alt" while you tap the "Tab" key a few times), fluxbox will lower the window again when you move on to the next one\&. This allows you to preview the windows in order, but does not change the order in doing so\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBNextGroup\fR [{\fIoptions\fR}] [\fIpattern\fR] / \fBPrevGroup\fR [{\fIoptions\fR}] [\fIpattern\fR]

\fBgroups\fR
option forced on\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBGotoWindow\fR \fInumber\fR [{\fIoptions\fR}] [\fIpattern\fR]
.RS 4
Focuses and activates the window at position
\fInumber\fR

\fIpattern\fR
arguments have the same meaning as
\fBNextWindow\fR
above\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBActivate\fR [\fIpattern\fR] | \fBFocus\fR [\fIpattern\fR]
.RS 4
With
\fIpattern\fR, this is an alias for
\fBGoToWindow\fR

Tries to arrange all windows on the current workspace so that they overlap the least amount possible\&.
\fBArrangeWindowsVertical\fR
prefers vertical splits (windows side by side), whereas

.RE
.PP
\fBArrangeWindowsStackLeft\fR \fIpattern\fR / \fBArrangeWindowsStackRight\fR \fIpattern\fR
.RS 4
Similar to
\fBArrangeWindows\fR, these commands arrange windows on the current workspace\&. The currently focussed window is used as the
\fImain\fR
window, and will fill half the screen, while the other windows are tiled on the other half of the screen as if they were tiled with ArrangeWindows\&.
\fBArrangeWindowsStackLeft\fR
puts the main window on the RIGHT hand side of the screen, and the tiled windows are on the LEFT hand side of the screen\&.

These commands affect the Window Manager, or more than one window\&.
.PP
\fBRestart\fR [\fIpath\fR]
.RS 4
Restarts fluxbox\&. This does not close any running applications\&. If the optional
\fIpath\fR
is a path to an executable window manager, that manager is started in place of fluxbox\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBQuit\fR | \fBExit\fR
.RS 4
Exits fluxbox\&. This will normally cause X to stop as well and terminate all existing applications, returning you to the login manager or console\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReconfig\fR | \fBReconfigure\fR
.RS 4
Reloads all fluxbox configuration files including the keys file, apps file, and init file, if they have changed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSetStyle\fR \fIpath\fR
.RS 4
Sets the current style to that given in
\fIpath\fR, which must be the full path to a fluxbox style\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReloadStyle\fR
.RS 4
Reloads only the current style\&. Useful after editing a style which is currently in use\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBExecCommand\fR \fIargs \&...\fR | \fBExec\fR \fIargs \&...\fR | \fBExecute\fR \fIargs \&...\fR
.RS 4
Probably the most\-used binding of all\&. Passes all the arguments to your
\fB$SHELL\fR
(or /bin/sh if $SHELL is not set)\&. You can use this to launch applications, run shell scripts, etc\&. Since all arguments are passed verbatim to the shell, you can use environment variables, pipes, or anything else the shell can do\&. Note that processes only see environment variables that were set before fluxbox started (such as in
\fB~/\&.fluxbox/startup\fR), or any that are set via the
\fBExport\fR
or
\fBSetEnv\fR
commands, below\&. See
\fBfluxbox(1)\fR
for more details on the
\fBENVIRONMENT\fR
and
\fB\e~/\&.fluxbox/startup\fR
file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBCommandDialog\fR
.RS 4
Pops up a dialog box that lets you type in any of these commands manually\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSetEnv\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR | \fBExport\fR \fIname\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Sets an environment variable in Fluxbox\&. It will be passed to any applications spawned by any future ExecCommand commands\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSetResourceValue\fR \fIresourcename\fR \fIresourcevalue\fR | \fBSetResourceValueDialog\fR
.RS 4
Sets a fluxbox resource value, which are normally stored in the init file\&. See
\fIfluxbox(1)\fR
for more details on available resources and allowed values\&.
.RE
.SS "Special Commands"
.sp
These commands have special meanings or behaviors\&.
.PP
\fBMacroCmd\fR {\fIcommand1\fR} {\fIcommand2\fR} {\fIcommand3\fR} \fI\&...\fR
.RS 4
Allows you to execute more than one command with one keybinding\&. The commands will be executed in series\&. The
\fB{\fR\fB}\fR
brackets are literally required, as in the following example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
MacroCmd {MoveTo 0 0} {ResizeTo 1280 800}
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fBDelay\fR {\fIcommand\fR} [\fImicroseconds\fR]
.RS 4
Delays running
\fIcommand\fR
for the given amount of time\&. If the same key binding is activated again, the timer will be restarted\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBToggleCmd\fR {\fIcommand1\fR} {\fIcommand2\fR} \fI\&...\fR
.RS 4
Alternates between the commands\&. On the first press of the bound key, runs
\fIcommand1\fR\&. On the next press, runs
\fIcommand2\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBBindKey\fR \fIkeybinding\fR
.RS 4
Adds the given
\fIkeybinding\fR
(which must be a valid key binding as defined in the DESCRIPTION section above) to your keys file\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBKeyMode\fR \fIkeymode\fR [\fIreturn\-keybinding\fR]
.RS 4
Activates the named
\fIkeymode\fR
(or, all key binding lines prefaced with the same
\fIkeymode\fR:) and deactivates all others until the
\fIreturn\-keybinding\fR
(by default
\fBEscape\fR) is pressed\&. The default keymode is named
\fIdefault\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBForEach\fR {\fIcommand\fR} [{\fIcondition\fR}] | \fBMap\fR {\fIcommand\fR} [{\fIcondition\fR}]
.RS 4
Runs the given
\fIcommand\fR
(normally one from the
\fBWindow Commands\fR
section above) on each window\&. If you specify a
\fIcondition\fR
(See
\fBConditions\fR, below) the action will be limited to matching windows\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBIf\fR {\fIcondition\fR} {\fIthen\-command\fR} [{\fIelse\-command\fR}] | \fBCond\fR {\fIcondition\fR} {\fIthen\-command\fR} [{\fIelse\-command\fR}]
.RS 4
If the
\fIcondition\fR
command returns
\fBtrue\fR, then run the
\fIthen\-command\fR, otherwise run the optional
\fIelse\-command\fR\&. See
\fBConditions\fR
below for more information on the
\fIcondition\fR
argument\&.
.RE
.SS "Conditions"
.sp
These special commands are used to match windows conditionally\&. They are commonly used by the \fBIf\fR and \fBForEach\fR command\&.
.PP
\fBMatches\fR \fIpattern\fR
.RS 4
Returns
\fBtrue\fR
if the current window matches the given
\fIpattern\fR\&. See
\fBCLIENT PATTERNS\fR
below for details on the
\fIpattern\fR
syntax\&.
.sp
If your key binding uses the
\fBOnWindow\fR
modifier, it matches against the window you clicked, not the currently focused window\&.
.sp
To check other windows besides the currently focused one, see the
\fBEvery\fR
and
\fBSome\fR
conditions below\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSome\fR \fIcondition\fR
.RS 4
Returns
\fBtrue\fR
if any window on any workspace (not just the currently focused one) matches the
\fIcondition\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBEvery\fR \fIcondition\fR
.RS 4
Returns
\fBtrue\fR
if every window on every workspace (not just the current one) matches the
\fIcondition\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNot\fR \fIcondition\fR
.RS 4
Returns
\fBtrue\fR
if
\fIcondition\fR
returns
\fBfalse\fR, and vice\-versa\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBAnd\fR {\fIcondition1\fR} {\fIcondition2\fR} [{\fIcondition3\fR} \&...]
.RS 4
Returns
\fBtrue\fR
if and only if all given conditions return
\fBtrue\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBOr\fR {\fIcondition1\fR} {\fIcondition2\fR} [{\fIcondition3\fR} \&...]
.RS 4
Returns
\fBtrue\fR
if any of the listed conditions return
\fBtrue\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBXor\fR {\fIcondition1\fR} {\fIcondition2\fR} [{\fIcondition3\fR} \&...]
.RS 4
Returns the boolean
\fBxor\fR
of the truth values for all conditions listed\&.
.RE
.SH "CLIENT PATTERNS"
.sp
Many of the more advanced commands take a \fIpattern\fR argument, which allows you to direct the action at a specific window or set of windows which match the properties specified in the \fIpattern\fR\&.
.PP
A \fIpattern\fR looks like this
.RS 4
\fB(\fR[\fIpropertyname\fR[!]=]\fIregexp\fR\fB)\fR
\&...
.RE
.sp
Match definitions are enclosed in parentheses \fB(\fR\&...\fB)\fR, and if no \fIpropertyname\fR is given then \fBName\fR is assumed\&. The \fIregexp\fR can contain any regular expression, or the special value \fB[current]\fR, which matches the corresponding value of the currently focused window\&. See \fIregex(7)\fR for more information on acceptable regular expressions\&.
.sp
\fIpropertyname\fR is not case sensitive, whereas the \fIregexp\fR is\&.
.sp
If you specify multiple \fB(\fR\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR) arguments, this implies an AND condition \- All specified patterns must match\&.
.sp
You can use \fB=\fR to test for equality or \fB!=\fR to test for inequality\&.
