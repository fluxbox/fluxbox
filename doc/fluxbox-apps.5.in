.SH "NAME"
fluxbox-apps \- per\-window attribute configuration for fluxbox(1)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
~/\&.fluxbox/apps
.SH "SYNTAX"
.sp
Variable parameters are shown in emphasis: \fIargument\fR
.sp
All other characters shown are required verbatim\&. Whitespace is only required to delimit words, but it is fine to add more whitespace\&.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
It is possible to force an application to always have the same dimensions, position, and other settings when it is first launched\&. These settings are saved in the \(oqapps\(cq file\&.
.sp
Most simple settings can be saved using the \(lqRemember\&...\(rq submenu of the window menu, which can usually be opened with a right\-click on the titlebar\&. More advanced features require manually editing the \(oqapps\(cq file\&. This may include using \fBGROUP SECTIONS\fR to set up automatic window tab groups\&.
.sp
You do not need to \(lqreload\(rq fluxbox after editing the apps file, the changes should be rescanned when the next window is opened\&.
.sp
The file is made up of two main types of sections, apps and groups, detailed below\&.
.SH "APP SECTIONS"
.sp
\fB[app]\fR sections provide settings for individual application windows\&.
.PP
These sections begin with a line of the format
.RS 4
\fB[app]\fR\fB(\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB)\fR\fB{\fR\fIcount\fR\fB}\fR
.RE
.sp
The \fIpattern\fR can be one or more patterns which match windows\&. For more details, see \fBCLIENT PATTERNS\fR\&. If you specify more than one \fIpattern\fR, they must ALL match for the settings to be applied\&.
.sp
The \fB{\fR\fIcount\fR\fB}\fR is optional\&. If specified, then the entry will only match at most that many windows at any time\&. If omitted, the default is to apply the settings to all matching windows\&.
.sp
This opening \fB[apps]\fR line is followed by any number of settings for the application\&. See \fBSETTINGS\fR for more details\&.
.PP
Each of these sections ends with the single line
.RS 4
\fB[end]\fR
.RE
.SH "GROUP SECTIONS"
.sp
The primary purpose of \fB[group]\fR sections is to group windows together\&. All windows in a group will be tabbed together automatically\&.
.PP
These sections begin with a line of the format
.RS 4
\fB[group]\fR\fB(\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB)\fR
.RE
.sp
Where the \fIpattern\fR item is optional\&. If specified, this pattern must match for the group to take effect\&. It is common to use non\-window\-specific patterns such as \fB(workspace)\fR here\&. See \fBCLIENT PATTERNS\fR for more details\&.
.sp
This is followed by any number of \fB[app]\fR lines\&. These have a similar format to the \fB[app]\fR section detailed above in \fBAPP SECTIONS\fR, but do not contain any settings and do not have an associated \fB[end]\fR line\&.
.PP
Like this
.RS 4
\fB[app]\fR\fB(\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB)\fR
.RE
.sp
This section may also contain settings that are applied to every window in the group\&. See the \fBSETTINGS\fR section for details\&.
.PP
As with \fB[app]\fR sections, each of these sections ends with the single line
.RS 4
\fB[end]\fR
.RE
.SH "SETTINGS"
.sp
These settings may be stored in the \(oqapps\(cq file\&. A settings line must appear inside either an \fB[app]\fR or \fB[group]\fR section\&.
.PP
The general format is
.RS 4
\fB[\fR\fIsetting\fR\fB]\fR\fB{\fR\fIvalue\fR\fB}\fR
.RE
.sp
All allowed values are described below, except for \fIbool\fR which can simply have the value \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR, which enables or disables the associated setting, respectively\&.
.PP
\fB[Workspace]\fR {\fInumber\fR}
.RS 4
Forces the application to open on the
\fInumber\fR
workspace specified\&. Workspaces are set by number, beginning with 0\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Jump]\fR {\fIbool\fR}
.RS 4
Changes the active workspace to the remembered one when the application is opened\&. This is only useful when used in conjunction with
\fI[Workspace]\fR\&. See
\fBEXAMPLES\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Head]\fR {\fInumber\fR}
.RS 4
Forces the application to open on the
\fInumber\fR
head specified (Xinerama only)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Layer]\fR {\fInumber\fR}
.RS 4
Specify the layer to open the window on (by number)\&. Each layer has a number\&. The named ones are: 2\-AboveDock, 4\-Dock, 6\-Top, 8\-Normal, 10\-Bottom, 12\-Desktop\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Dimensions]\fR {\fIwidth[%]\fR \fIheight[%]\fR}
.RS 4
Opens the application with the specified
\fIwidth\fR
and
\fIheight\fR, in pixels\&. If the value is given in percent, then the window size will be based on the current screen\(cqs size\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Position]\fR (\fIanchor\fR) {\fIX[%]\fR \fIY[%]\fR}
.RS 4
Position the application at a particular spot\&. By default the upper\-left corner is placed at screen coordinates (\fIX\fR,\fIY\fR)\&. If you specify an
\fIanchor\fR, say BottomRight, then the lower\-right corner of the window is positioned (\fIX\fR,\fIY\fR) pixels from the lower\-right corner of the screen\&. If the value is given in percent, then the coordinates will be based on the current screen\(cqs size\&.
.PP
\fIanchor\fR may be set to one of:
.RS 4
\fBTopLeft Left BottomLeft Top Center Bottom TopRight Right BottomRight\fR
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB[Deco]\fR {\fIvalue\fR}
.RS 4
.PP
Specify the decoration state\&. There are several predefined \fIvalue\fR sets:
.RS 4
.PP

.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fBNONE\fR
.RS 4
No decorations

.PP
\fBTINY\fR
.RS 4
Titlebar with only an iconify button
.RE
.PP
\fBTOOL\fR

.RS 4
Whether the window has tabs enabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[FocusNewWindow]\fR {\fIbool\fR}
.RS 4

.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
\fB[Maximized]\fR {\fIvalue\fR}
.RS 4
.PP

.RE
.SH "CLIENT PATTERNS"
.PP
A \fIpattern\fR looks like this
.RS 4
\fB(\fR[\fIpropertyname\fR[!]=]\fIregexp\fR\fB)\fR
\&...
.RE
.sp
Match definitions are enclosed in parentheses \fB(\fR\&...\fB)\fR, and if no \fIpropertyname\fR is given then \fBName\fR is assumed\&. The \fIregexp\fR can contain any regular expression, or the special value \fB[current]\fR, which matches the corresponding value of the currently focused window\&. See \fIregex(7)\fR for more information on acceptable regular expressions\&.
.sp
\fIpropertyname\fR is not case sensitive, whereas the \fIregexp\fR is\&.
.sp
If you specify multiple \fB(\fR\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR) arguments, this implies an AND condition \- All specified patterns must match\&.
.sp
You can use \fB=\fR to test for equality or \fB!=\fR to test for inequality\&.
