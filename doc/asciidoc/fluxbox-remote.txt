NAME
----
fluxbox-remote - command line access to key commands for fluxbox(1)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fluxbox-remote* 'command'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'fluxbox-remote(1)' is designed to allow scripts to execute most key commands
from 'fluxbox(1)'. 'fluxbox-remote(1)' will only work with 'fluxbox(1)': its
communications with 'fluxbox(1)' are not standardized in any way. It is
recommended that a standards-based tool such as 'wmctrl(1)' be used whenever
possible, in order for scripts to work with other window managers.

CAVEATS
-------
'fluxbox-remote(1)' uses the X11 protocol to communicate with 'fluxbox(1)'.
Therefore, it is possible for any user with access to the 'X(7)' server to use
'fluxbox-remote(1)'. For this reason, several key commands have been disabled.
Users should be aware of the security implications when enabling
'fluxbox-remote(1)', especially when using a forwarded 'X(7)' connection.

RESOURCES
---------
session.screen0.allowRemoteActions: <boolean>::
      This resource in ~/.fluxbox/init must be set to `true' in order for
      'fluxbox-remote(1)' to function. Please read the *CAVEATS* first.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
In order to communicate with 'fluxbox(1)', the DISPLAY environment variable must
be set properly. Usually, the value should be `:0.0'.
