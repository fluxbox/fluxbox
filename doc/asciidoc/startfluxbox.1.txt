NAME
----
startfluxbox - start a fluxbox session

SYNOPSIS
--------
*startfluxbox*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*startfluxbox* is a script which runs the file *~/.fluxbox/startup* If it
doesn't exist it will be generated.

*startfluxbox* should be started from your *\~/.xinitrc* if you use startx, or
 *~/.xsession* if you run a display manager, like xdm.

FILES
-----
*~/.fluxbox/startup*::
    This file contains all commands that should be executed before fluxbox is
    started. The initial file contains helpful comments for beginners. It also
    starts fluxbox.

EXAMPLES
--------
The default *~/.fluxbox/startup* is as follows:
....
#!/bin/sh
#
# fluxbox startup-script:
#
# Lines starting with a '#' are ignored.

# Change your keymap:
xmodmap "$HOME/.Xmodmap"

# Applications you want to run with fluxbox.
# MAKE SURE THAT APPS THAT KEEP RUNNING HAVE AN ''&'' AT THE END.
#
# unclutter -idle 2 &
# wmnd &
# wmsmixer -w &
# idesk &

# And last but not least we start fluxbox.
# Because it is the last app you have to run it with ''exec'' before it.

exec fluxbox
# or if you want to keep a log:
# exec fluxbox -log "$fluxdir/log"
....

If you need to start applications after fluxbox, you can change the *exec
fluxbox* line above to something like this:
....
exec fluxbox &
fbpid=$!

sleep 1
{
    xsetroot -cursor_name left_ptr -fg white -bg black &
    ipager &
    gkrellm2 &
} &

wait $fbpid
....
So xsetroot, ipager, and gkrellm2 will all be started after fluxbox, after
giving fluxbox 1 second to startup.

For more details on what else you can do in this script, see *sh(1)*, or the
documentation for your shell.
