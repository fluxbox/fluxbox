NAME
----
fluxbox-apps - per-window attribute configuration for fluxbox(1)

SYNOPSIS
--------
~/.fluxbox/apps

SYNTAX
------
Variable parameters are shown in emphasis: 'argument'

All other characters shown are required verbatim. Whitespace is only required to
delimit words, but it is fine to add more whitespace.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
It is possible to force an application to always have the same dimensions,
position, and other settings when it is first launched. These settings are saved
in the `apps' file.

Most simple settings can be saved using the ``Remember...'' submenu of the
window menu, which can usually be opened with a right-click on the titlebar.
More advanced features require manually editing the `apps' file. This may
include using *GROUP SECTIONS* to set up automatic window tab groups.

You do not need to ``reload'' fluxbox after editing the apps file, the changes
should be rescanned when the next window is opened.

The file is made up of two main types of sections, apps and groups, detailed
below.

APP SECTIONS
------------
*[app]* sections provide settings for individual application windows.

These sections begin with a line of the format:::
    *[app]* *(*'pattern'*)* *{*'count'*}*

The 'pattern' can be one or more patterns which match windows. For more
details, see *CLIENT PATTERNS*. If you specify more than one 'pattern', they
must ALL match for the settings to be applied.

The *{*'count'*}* is optional. If specified, then the entry will only match at
most that many windows at any time. If omitted, the default is to apply the
settings to all matching windows.

This opening *[apps]* line is followed by any number of settings for the
application. See *SETTINGS* for more details.

Each of these sections ends with the single line:::
    *[end]*

TRANSIENT SECTIONS
------------------
*[transient]* sections provide settings for "dialogs".

This is the same as the *[app]* section, but applies to transient windows.
Transient windows have a WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property. This will apply to all
modal and several other dialogs which have a "leader" they remain above.
Notably, open/save dialogs fall into this category.

GROUP SECTIONS
--------------
The primary purpose of *[group]* sections is to group windows together. All
windows in a group will be tabbed together automatically.

These sections begin with a line of the format:::
    *[group]* *(*'pattern'*)*

Where the 'pattern' item is optional. If specified, this pattern must match for
the group to take effect. It is common to use non-window-specific patterns such
as *(workspace)* here. See *CLIENT PATTERNS* for more details.

This is followed by any number of *[app]* lines. These have a similar format to
the *[app]* section detailed above in *APP SECTIONS*, but do not contain any
settings and do not have an associated *[end]* line.

Like this:::
    *[app]* *(*'pattern'*)*

This section may also contain settings that are applied to every window in the
group. See the *SETTINGS* section for details.

As with *[app]* sections, each of these sections ends with the single line:::
    *[end]*

SETTINGS
--------
These settings may be stored in the `apps' file. A settings line must appear
inside either an *[app]* or *[group]* section.

The general format is:::
    *[*'setting'*]* *{*'value'*}*

All allowed values are described below, except for 'bool' which can simply have
the value *yes* or *no*, which enables or disables the associated setting,
respectively.

*[Workspace]* {'number'}::
    Forces the application to open on the 'number' workspace specified.
    Workspaces are set by number, beginning with 0.

*[Jump]* {'bool'}::
    Changes the active workspace to the remembered one when the application is
    opened. This is only useful when used in conjunction with '[Workspace]'. See
    *EXAMPLES*.

*[Head]* {'number'}::
    Forces the application to open on the 'number' head specified (Xinerama
    only).

*[Layer]* {'number'}::
    Specify the layer to open the window on (by number). Each layer has a
    number. The named ones are: 2-AboveDock, 4-Dock, 6-Top, 8-Normal, 10-Bottom,
    12-Desktop.

*[Dimensions]* {'width[%]' 'height[%]'}::
    Opens the application with the specified 'width' and 'height', in pixels.
    If the value is given in percent, then the window size will be based on
    the current screen's size.

*[Position]* ('anchor') {'X[%]' 'Y[%]'}::
Position the application at a particular spot. By default the upper-left corner
is placed at screen coordinates ('X','Y'). If you specify an 'anchor', say
BottomRight, then the lower-right corner of the window is positioned ('X','Y')
pixels from the lower-right corner of the screen. If the value is given in
percent, then the coordinates will be based on the current screen's size.
+
'anchor' may be set to one of:;;
*TopLeft Left BottomLeft Top Center Bottom TopRight Right BottomRight*

*[Deco]* {'value'}::
Specify the decoration state. There are several predefined 'value' sets:;;
+
--
    *NORMAL*;;
        Standard decorations
    *NONE*;;
        No decorations
    *BORDER*;;
        Like NONE except keep the X window border
    *TAB*;;
        Like BORDER except keep external tabs (if enabled)
    *TINY*;;
        Titlebar with only an iconify button
    *TOOL*;;
        Titlebar only

--
+
The 'value' may also be a bitmask for finer-grained control. The bits are, from
(1<<0) to (1<<10): Titlebar, Handle/Grips, Border, Iconify Button, Maximize
Button, Close Button, Menu Button, Sticky Button, Shade Button, External Tabs, Focus Enabled.

*[Shaded]* {'bool'}::
    Whether the window is Shaded (rolled-up) or not.

*[Tab]* {'bool'}::
    Whether the window has tabs enabled.

*[FocusNewWindow]* {'bool'}::
    *DEPRECATED!* Please use FocusProtection "Gain" or "Refuse" instead.;;
    If enabled, a new window will grab X focus as soon as it is opened.
    If disabled, a new window will not grab X focus as soon as it is opened.

*[FocusProtection]* {'value' [,'value' [, ...]] }::
    Comma separated list of focus controlling flags. 'value' may be:;;
+
--
    *None*;;
        Regular behavior
    *Gain*;;
        A new window will grab X focus as soon as it is opened.
    *Refuse*;;
        A new window will not grab X focus as soon as it is opened.
    *Deny*;;
        The window is not allowed to claim focus while it is opened.
    *Lock*;;
        No window is allowed to claim the focus while this window has it.
--
    Please notice that technically, windows may still obtain the focus which is then however reverted by the WM. In case you're very unlucky, a key event may thus still go to the wrong window.

*[FocusHidden]* {'bool'}::
    If enabled, the window will not appear in 'NextWindow'/'PrevWindow' lists.

*[IconHidden]* {'bool'}::
    If enabled, the window will not appear in the icon area of the toolbar.

*[Hidden]* {'bool'}::
    A shortcut for setting both *FocusHidden* and *IconHidden* at the same time.

*[Sticky]* {'bool'}::
    Specify if an application should be sticky (shown on all workspaces) or not.

*[Minimized]* {'bool'}::
    Application should start minimized

*[Maximized]* {'value'}::
Application should start maximized. 'value' may be:;;
+
--
    *yes*;;
        Fully maximized
    *horz*;;
        Horizontally maximized
    *vert*;;
        Vertically maximized
    *no*;;
        Not maximized

--

*[Fullscreen]* {'bool'}::
    Application should start in fullscreen mode (fully maximized without any
    decorations).

*[Close]* {'bool'}::
    Save settings on close. By default, application settings are not updated when
    a window is closed.

*[Alpha]* {'value' ['value']}::
    Set the alpha value for this window. If two values are given, they
    correspond to the focused and unfocused transparency, respectively. One
    number only will be used for both values. 'value' is an integer between 0
    and 255.
