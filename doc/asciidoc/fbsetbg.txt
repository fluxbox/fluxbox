NAME
----
fbsetbg - Set a background wallpaper or pattern

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fbsetbg* [*-uU* 'wallpapersetter'] [*-fFcCtTaA*] 'wallpaper'

*fbsetbg* [*-uU* 'wallpapersetter'] *-rR* 'path'

*fbsetbg* *-bB* 'fbsetrootoptions...'

*fbsetbg* [-*l*|*h*|*i*|*p*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fbsetbg(1)* is a wrapper that tries to find a suitable background-setting app
and then tries to set the wallpaper using that app. You don't have to configure
fbsetbg. It just uses the first app it can find.

Furthermore it supports remembering the last set wallpaper so you don't have to
edit the style or init-file to change the wallpaper.

It aims to provide clear error messages in a window that make debugging problems
easy.

OPTIONS
-------
*-f* 'file'::
Set fullscreen wallpaper.

*-c* 'file'::
Set centered wallpaper.

*-t* 'file'::
Set tiled wallpaper.

*-a* 'file'::
Set maximized wallpaper, preserving aspect (if your bgsetter
doesn't support this option fbsetbg falls back to *-f*).

*-u* 'wallpapersetter'::
Use specified wallpapersetter, use no argument to forget.

*-b* 'fbsetrootoptions'::
Forward the options to *fbsetroot(1)*. These can be used to set a solid,
pattern, or gradient background texture.

*-r* 'directory'::
Set random wallpaper from a directory.

*-F*, *-C*, *-T*, *-A*, *-U*, *-B*, *-R*::
Same as the lowercase option but without remembering.

*-l*::
Set previous wallpaper. Or, if the random feature was last used,
set another random wallpaper from the same directory.

*-i*::
Display useful information about best wallpapersetter found.

*-p*::
Display some useful tips.

*-h*::
Display a help message.

FILES
-----
*~/.fluxbox/lastwallpaper*::
In this file the wallpaper you set will be stored, for the *-l* option.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*wpsetters*::
Wallpapersetters to use. This can be a space-delimited list of the applications
to try, or just a single name.

*DISPLAY*::
The display you want to set the wallpaper on.

EXAMPLES
--------
To use *feh(1)* as wallpapersetter and set *wallpapper.jpg* from the current
directory as wallpaper.

    $ wpsetters=feh fbsetbg wallpaper.jpg

Recall the last set wallpaper on display *:0.0* with the stored options.

    $ DISPLAY=:0.0 fbsetbg -l
