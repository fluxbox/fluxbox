NAME
----
fbrun - display run dialog window

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fbrun* ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fbrun(1)* is  basically equivalent to the ``Run...'' dialog in other desktop
environments. This means that it is an easy way to start a program that isn't
contained  in the menu (or needs a special set of parameters for this particular
invocation).

Pressing ``Enter'' will close the window and execute the command in your present
*$SHELL*. Pressing ``Esc'' will close the window and does not execute anything.

Another way fbrun can be useful is to be called from the  menu  with  a
preloaded  command  line that you can edit and then execute. An example might be
sshing to a very long host name with lots of options of  which one  changes  all
the  time.  In this case, you could add an entry for fbrun to your menu that
contains all the options  and  the  host  name.  When  you use said entry, you
could edit the line as necessary and execute it.
