NAME
----
fbsetroot - a simple background utility used by the fluxbox(1) window manager,
originally written for and by the original blackbox(1) window manager.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fbsetroot* [-display 'display'] -solid 'color'

*fbsetroot* [-display 'display'] -mod 'x' 'y' -fg 'color' -bg 'color'

*fbsetroot* [-display 'display'] -gradient 'texture' -from 'color' -to 'color'

*fbsetroot* -help

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fbsetroot(1)* is a utility that can control the appearance of the root window
in three ways: Either give it a solid color, or write a two color modula pattern
to it, or render a gradient texture, based on two different colors.

fbsetroot resembles *xsetroot(1)* in this functionality but it supports
multiple-screen displays, and gradient textures the same way as blackbox or
fluxbox does. It doesn't handle cursors etc. fbsetroot was originally part of
the Blackbox package and was carried over with the code that became Fluxbox. It
was called bsetroot back in those days.

If any errors are encountered, fbsetroot will use either *gxmessage(1)* or
*xmessage(1)* to inform the user of errors.

OPTIONS
-------
fbsetroot operates in three ways, you must choose one of  the  first  3
options:

*-solid* 'color'::
Sets the root window to specified color.

*-mod* 'x' 'y'::
Creates a modula pattern. You must specify *-bg* and *-fg* colors.

*-gradient* 'texturestring'::
Renders the specified texture string to the root window.
+
'texturestring' may be one of:;;
    *Horizontal  /  Vertical / Diagonal / Crossdiagonal / Pipecross / Elliptic /
Rectangle / Pyramid*
+
Select one of these texture types, they only apply when  *-gradient* is
specified.  You must also specify both a *-from* and a *-to* color.

*-display* 'display'::
Tells fbsetroot to connect to the specified display.

*-bg, -background* 'color'::
Background color.  Needed for *-mod* patterns.

*-fg, -foreground* 'color'::
Foreground color.  Needed for *-mod* patterns.

*-from* 'color'::
Start color for rendering textures.  Needed for *-gradient* patterns.

*-to* 'color'::
Ending color for rendering textures.  Needed for *-gradient* patterns.

*-help*::
Prints version info and short help text.
